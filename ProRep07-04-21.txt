[I'm sorry this has taken so long. I don't know why I'm so very out of it
this week, but I hope to improve my performance going forward. I honestly
thought I'd sent this already, which]

ID: 8575
Title: Nicer Definitions
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: R. Lee

Amend rule 2152, "Mother May I", by replacing

  "SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED: Before performing the
  described action, the full implications of performing it should
   be understood and carefully weighed."

with


  ""SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED: Before performing the
  described action, the full implications of performing it ought to be
  be understood and carefully weighed."


and also by replacing

  "SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED: Before failing to perform the
   described action, the full implications of failing to perform
   it should (in the ordinary-language sense) be understood and
   carefully weighed."

with

  "SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED: Before failing to perform the
  described action, the full implications of failing to perform
  it ought to be understood and
  carefully weighed."

[Explanation: The word SHOULD is currently defined as meaning the word
should. This is not technically recursive because the upper case terms are
terms of art, but it looks awful. This proposal means that it becomes
"ought to", which just looks better. I also get to remove a terribly clunky
parenthetical.]

Amend rule 2438, "Ribbons", by deleting the last list item.
[Comment: Awarding coins can be done at power 1, piggybacking off of the
Ribbon rule. No reason to have Glitter here at power 3]

Amend rule 2602, "Glitter" to read, in full:

  "Each type of Ribbon has a corresponding type of Glitter
  with the same name. A player qualifies for a type of Glitter
  when e qualifies for the same type of Ribbon while already
  owning such a Ribbon. If a player has not been awarded
  that type of Ribbon or e corresponding type of Glitter
  since e last earned or came to qualify for that type of
  Ribbon, and has not been so awarded five or more times
  within the past 24 hours, any player CAN award em that
  type of Glitter by announcement. When a player gains
  a type of Glitter, the Tailor SHALL in an officially
  timely fashion and CAN once by announcement award em
  N/2 boatloads of coins rounded up, where N is the number
  of players that did not own the corresponding type of
  Ribbon at the time of the award. The amount payable for
  each type of Glitter is tracked in the Tailor's weekly
  report.

[comment: Nonplayer persons can currently get Glitter, they don't need to
be able to though because it does nothing. N+1 becomes N/2 because Glitter
is currently the most powerful way to get coins, by far. ]
