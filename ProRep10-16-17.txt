ID: 7922
Title: Clarity Act
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Alexis
Co-authors:


Text in square brackets is not a part of this proposal's substance and
is ignored when it takes effect.

Enact a new power 3 rule entitled Voting Methods, reading as follows:

  Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which must be
  AI-majority, instant runoff, or first-past-the-post. The voting
  method is that specified by the authorizing authority, or
  first-past-the-post by default.

  Each Agoran decision has a set of valid options (the choices that
  the voters are being asked to select from) and valid votes (the
  ways in which the voters can express their opinion or lack thereof.
  For AI-majority decisions, the valid options are FOR and AGAINST;
  for other decisions, the valid options are defined by other rules.

  The valid votes on an Agoran decision are:
  1. PRESENT;
  2. The valid conditional votes, as defined by rules of power at
     least that of this rule; and
  3. For an instant runoff decision, the ordered lists of entities.
  4. For any other decision, the valid options.

[This splits off the portion of 955 that isn't actually related to
 resolution. The definition of instant runoff is changed to evaluate
 validity of options at the end of the voting period, and avoid
 retroactively invalidating votes if an option drops out.]

Amend Rule 955 by replacing the second paragraph and numbered list with
the following and by deleting the second bullet in the unnumbered list.

  1. For an AI-majority decision, let F be the total strength of all
     valid ballots cast FOR a decision, A be the same for AGAINST,
     and AI be the adoption index of the decision. The outcome is
     ADOPTED if F/A >= AI and F/A > 1 (or F>0 and A=0), otherwise
     REJECTED.

  2. For an instant runoff decision, the outcome is whichever option
     wins according to the standard definition of instant runoff.
     For this purpose, a ballot of strength N is treated as if it
     were N distinct ballots expressing the same preferences. In
     case multiple valid options tie for the lowest number of votes
     at any stage, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
     announcement of the decision's resolution, select one such
     option to eliminate; if, for M > 1, all eir possible choices in
     the next M stages would result in the same set of options being
     eliminated, e need not specify the order of elimination. If an
     entity that is part of a valid vote is not a valid option at
     the end of the voting period, or disqualified by the rule
     providing for the decision, then that entity is eliminated
     prior to the first round of counting.

  3. For a first-past-the-post decision, the outcome is whichever
     option received the highest total strength of valid ballots. In
     case of a tie, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
     announcement of the decision's resolution, select one of the
     leaders as the outcome.

[No change here, except for removing the valid votes, and clearly
 specifying what happens to options that are no longer valid at the end
 of the voting period.]

If the text "The rule providing for an Agoran Decision by instant runoff
may disqualify one or more options; in such a case, they are eliminated
prior to beginning the first stage of the vote count." appears in Rule
955, delete it.

[Coordinating amendment to the Election Procedure proposal. H. Assessor,
 please resolve that one first.]

Amend Rule 2127 to read as follows:

  A conditional vote on an Agoran decision is a vote which indicates
  a vote based on some condition(s). A conditional vote is evaluated
  at the end of the voting period and, rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding, is clearly specified if and only if the value of
  the condition(s) is/are determinate at the end of the voting
  period. If the conditional is clearly specified, and evaluates to
  a valid vote, it is counted as that vote; otherwise, it is counted
  as PRESENT.

  Any vote which is clearly expressed as a conditional, e.g. "FOR if
  <X> is true, AGAINST otherwise", is a valid conditional vote that
  evaluates as specified.

  A vote endorsing another person is equivalent to a conditional
  vote evaluating to the vote specified in that person's valid
  ballot on the decision, if any.

  For an instant runoff decision, a vote consisting of a list, one
  or more entries of which are valid conditional votes, and the
  remaining entries of which are valid options, is a valid
  conditional vote. Such a vote is evaluated by evaluating each
  conditional entry to a list of votes (or an empty list, if it
  evaluates to PRESENT either directly or indirectly), and then
  concatenating those lists with the specified valid options in the
  order they occurred in the original vote.

[New conditional vote rule clearly specifies what conditional votes are
 valid, as well as providing for evaluation of conditional lists in
 instant runoff in the sensible way.]

Amend Rule 2438 by replacing the paragraph describing Orange
Ribbons with:

  Orange (O): When a proposal is adopted via an Agoran Decision on
  which no valid ballots were AGAINST (after evaluating
  conditionals), its proposer earns an Orange Ribbon.

Award G. a Transparent Ribbon.

[I accept that it's fair that this may not actually be a problem,
but clarifying it and converging gamestate does not hurt.]

Amend Rule 2493, "Regulations", by

  * Replacing every instance of the word "instrument" with the words "textual
    entity"; and
  * Amending the second paragraph to read in full "A regulation must be
    authorized by at least one rule in order for it to exist. A regulation has
    effect on the game (only) insofar as the rule or rules that authorized it
    permit it to have effect. If reasonably possible, a regulation should be
    interpreted so as to defer to other rules. The procedure for resolving

  person or persons win the game, otherwise the tournament
  concludes with no winner.

  In a timely fashion after the start of June 1 of each year,
  the Herald SHALL propose a set of Regulations governing a
  Birthday Tournament for that year; the Herald CAN also
  delegate the responsibility for creating or running the
  tournament to another player, with that player's consent.

  The Birthday Tournament's regulations SHOULD be such that all
  persons who choose to participate have a fair chance of winning
  the tournament (according to its regulations), and a winner
  SHOULD be expected within 2-3 weeks following the tournament's
  initiation.

  After adequate time for discussion of the Birthday Tournament's
  regulations, the Herald (or delegate) CAN initiate a sanctioned
  tournament with a specified, finalized set of regulations,
  Without 3 Objections.  The initiation SHOULD be timed to
  coincide with Agora's Birthday.

Amend Rule 911 (Motions and Moots) by replacing its first 2 paragraphs
with:

  If a judgement has been in effect for less then seven days and
  has not been entered into Moot, then:

      - The judge of that CFJ CAN self-file a Motion to Reconsider
        the case by announcement, if e has not already self-filed
        a Motion to Reconsider that CFJ.
      - Any Player CAN group-file a Motion to Reconsider the case
        with 2 Support, if the CFJ has not had a Motion to
        Reconsider group-filed for it at any time while it has
        been assigned to its current judge.

  When a Motion to Reconsider is so filed, the case is rendered
  open again.

  If a CFJ has a judgement assigned, a player CAN enter that
  judgement into Moot with N+2 support, where N is the number of
  weeks since that judgement has been assigned, rounded down. When
  this occurs, the CFJ is suspended, and the Arbitor is once
  authorized to initiate the Agoran decision to determine public
  confidence in the judgement, which e SHALL do in a timely
  fashion.


[The judge gets one Motion by announcement, one Motion is allowed
w/2 support (judge can do that one, too).  Moot has a practical time
limit but not an absolute one as the difficulty of initiating a Moot
increases with time].

# 1.3 Agency Cleanup

Repeal Rule 2467 ("Agencies")

Repeal Rule 2468 ("Superintendent")

# 1.4 Define Extricability

[Note that I do not believe this section makes any substantive changes on its
own. Because of the volume of concerns raised about restricting by announcement
conditionals, this section only contains definitions.]

Create a new power 3.0 rule entitled "Conditionals and Extricability", with the
following text:

  A conditional is any textual structure that attempts to make a statement (the
  substrate) affecting any part or aspect of the gamestate, or the
  permissibility, possibility, or effect of any action affecting such a part or
  aspect, dependent on the truth value or other state of a textual structure
  (the condition). The condition is said to be "affixed" to the substrate
  (inverse "to be conditional upon").

  A condition is inextricable if it is unclear, ambiguous, circular,
  inconsistent, paradoxical, depends on information that is indeterminate, or
  is impossible or unreasonably difficult to determine, or otherwise requires an
  unreasonable effort to resolve; otherwise it is extricable. A conditional is
  inextricable if its condition is inextricable; otherwise it is extricable. A
  player SHOULD NOT use an inextricable conditional for any purpose.

  An action is said to be "subject to" a conditional if its possibility,
  permissibility, or effect (depending on context) is determined by the
  conditional. A value is said to be subject to a conditional of the state
  of the value is determined by the conditional.

Create a new power 3.0 rule entitled "Determinacy", with the following text:

  If a value CANNOT be reasonably determined (without circularity or paradox)
  from information reasonably available, or if it alternates indefinitely
  between values, then the value is considered to be indeterminate, otherwise
  it is determinate.

Amend Rule 1023, "Common Definitions", by (please note that these actions
are severable):

    * removing the third item of the top level list;
    * renumbering appropriately; and
    * changing its title to "Agoran Time"


# 1.5 General-purpose Rules

Reenact Rule 1586, "Definition and Continuity of Entities" (Power = 2), with
the text:

  If multiple rules attempt to define an entity with the same name, then they
  refer to the same entity. A rule-defined entity's name CANNOT be changed to
  be the same as another rule-defined entity's name.

  A rule, contract, or regulation that refers to an entity by name refers to the
  entity that had that name when the rule first came to include that reference,
  even if the entity's name has since changed.

  If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it no longer
  defines the second entity, then the second entity and its attributes cease to
  exist.

  If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it defines
  the second entity both before and after the amendment, but with different
  attributes, then the second entity and its attributes continue to exist to
  whatever extent is possible under the new definitions.

Create a new power 3 rule entitled "Consent", with the following text:

  A person gives consent (syn. consents) to an action when e, acting as emself,
  publicly states that e agrees to the action. This agreement may be implied,
  but only if it is reasonably clear from context that the person wanted the
  agreement to take place.

# 1.6 Random Amendments

Amend Rule 869, "How to Join and Leave Agora", by changing its last paragraph to
read:

  The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act without their express or reasonably
  implied consent. The rules CANNOT compel players to unduly harass non-players.
  A non-person CANNOT be a player, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.


Amend Rule 2139, "The Registrar", by changing the sentence "The Registrar is
also responsible for tracking any switches that would otherwise lack an officer
to track them, unless the switch is defined as untracked." to read "The
Registrar is also responsible for tracking any switches, defined in a rule,
that would otherwise lack an officer to track them, unless the switch is defined
as untracked."

Amend Rule 2466, "Acting on Behalf", by changing it to read in full:

  When a rule allows one person (the agent) to act on behalf of another
  (the principal) to perform an action, that agent CAN perform the action if it
  is POSSIBLE for the principal to do so, taking into account any prerequisites
  for the action. If the enabling rule does not specify the mechanism by which
  the agent may do so, then the agent CAN perform the action in the same manner
  in which the principal CAN do so, with the additional requirement that the
  agent must, in the message in which the action is performed, uniquely identify
  the principal and that the action is being taken on behalf of that person.

  A person SHALL NOT act on behalf of another person if doing so causes the
  second person to violate the rules. A person CANNOT act on behalf of another
  person to do anything except perform a game action; in particular, a person
  CANNOT act on behalf of another person to send a message, only to perform
  specific actions that might be taken within a message.

  When an action is performed on behalf of a principal, then the
  action is considered for all game purposes to have been performed by the
  principal, unless a rule specifically states that it is treated differently
  for some purpose, in which case it is treated as described by that rule.

  Allowing a person to act on behalf of another person is secured at power 2.0.
  This rule takes precedence over any rule that would prohibit a person from
  taking an action, except that it defers to any rule that imposes limitations
  specifically on actions taken on behalf of another person.


# 2 Contracts
# 2.1 Core Contract Features

Create a new power 2.5 rule, entitled "Contracts", with the following text:

  A contract is a ruleset-defined entity embodied in text. An entity can only
  become a contract through the appropriate ruleset defined procedures. Changes
  to the contract's text by rule defined mechanisms (including those delegated
  to the contract itself) do not change the identity of the contract.

  If any change to a contract's text, internal state, or other properties would
  cause them to become indeterminate and remain so for any non-infinitesimal
  amount of time, the change is canceled and does not occur.

  The following changes are secured at power 2.1: creating or modifying a
  contract or causing an entity to become a contract. [Note that,
  as a precaution, causing an entity to cease being a contract is not secured.]

  The properties of contracts, as defined by other rules, include the
  following:

    - Parties, persons who agree to be bound by and assume powers under
      the contract.
    - The ability to be amended or destroyed.
    - The ability to compel actions by their parties.
    - The ability to allow persons to take actions on the part of their parties.
    - The ability to define arbitrary classes of asset.
    - The ability to possess and control assets.

Create a new power 2.5 rule, entitled "Parties to Contracts", with the following
text:

  Each contract has an associated set of persons, known as the parties. The
  person who creates a contract is automatically a party. Other persons CAN
  become parties to a contract by announcement if the contract's text permits
  them to do so. Parties can leave a contract by announcement, ceasing being
  parties, if the contract's text permits them to do so. A contract CAN expel a
  party or group of parties by announcement, causing them to cease being
  parties.

  It is IMPOSSIBLE, by any means, for a person to become a party to a contract,
  for an contract to be created with a person as a party, or for an entity to
  become a contract with a person as a party, without that person's consent.
  This rule takes precedence over any rule that might make such a change
  possible.

Create a power 2.5 rule entitled "Contract Lifecycle", with the
following text:

  A person CAN create a contract by announcement by transferring 1 shiny to
  Agora, specifying the contract's text. A person SHALL NOT create more than
  X (where X is the contract limit) contracts per week by this method, and the
  Notary CAN destroy any excess (i.e. beyond the X permitted) contracts by
  announcement within 7 days of the contract's formation, but only if the
  contract(s) were excess at the time of their creation.

  The contract limit is an untracked singleton switch, defaulting to 3, with
  possible values of any integer between 3 and 7. The contract limit can be
  set to any valid value in a regulation promulgated by the Notary.
  The amendment limit is an untracked singleton switch, with possible values
  of integers greater than or equal to 5, or positive infinity (default).
  The amendment limit can be set in a regulation promulgated by the Notary.

  The person or persons who create a contract CAN and SHOULD also specify a
  name for the contract; if e does not do so, the Notary CAN and
  SHALL assign a name in a timely fashion.

  A contract CAN amend, destroy, or retitle itself by announcement. A player
  CAN amend, destroy, or retitle a contract without objection, even if its
  text denies em the ability to do so. Players SHOULD only use this mechanism
  to recover from situations where the contract is underspecified or has
  unintended effects.

  The Notary CAN by regulation stop the same contract from
  amending or retitling itself more than Y times (where Y is the amendment limit
  limit) combined times per Agoran day; e CANNOT stop a contract from being
  destroyed, or from being retitled or amended by any other means.

  If a contract has fulfilled its purpose, does not specify any gamestate
  affecting statements, or otherwise seems unlikely to be used, the Notary
  CAN and SHOULD destroy it with Agoran Consent. Any player CAN destroy a
  contract with 2 Agoran Consent. Players SHOULD NOT use the methods in this
  paragraph to further their private interests.

  If the possibility of any action defined by this rule is indeterminate, or
  is subject to a inextricable conditional, it is impossible.


# 2.2 Powers of Contracts

Create a new power 2.4 rule, entitled "Contracts as Agreements", with the
following text:

  The text of a contract can specify obligations upon its parties. Parties to
  a contract SHALL abide by its terms, breaching them neither negligently nor
  deliberately. The fact that the action described by the contract is in
  violation of the rules is not a defense if the violative nature is
  reasonably clear from its text. If whether an action is permitted or forbidden
  by a contract is indeterminate or subject to an inextricable conditional,
  it is presumptively permitted.

  As an exception to the provisions of the previous paragraph and the
  circumstances in which cards would ordinarily be appropriate, a person
  awarding a card under this rule MAY and CAN validly consider the equitable
  interests of justice and interests of the game, including the importance of
  the observation of contracts, as a mitigating or aggravating circumstances
  when awarding a card. Such a person MAY, CAN validly, and SHOULD also consider
  the instructions of the contract or contracts in question when issuing a card.


Create a new power 2.4 rule, entitled "Acting on Behalf via Contract", with
the following text:

  If a rule says that a contract CAN do something by announcement, it is
  equivalent to saying that that any person CAN take that action by announcement
  if the contract's text says that e CAN do so under the circumstances; if
  whether the contract enables the person to do so is indeterminate, or is the
  subject of an inextricable conditional, the action is IMPOSSIBLE. A person
  SHALL NOT cause a contract to violate a rule using this method.

  If a rule specifies that a contract SHALL or SHALL NOT do something, each
  party to the contract SHALL ensure that the contract respectively does
  or does not do that thing.

  The text of a contract can permit persons to act on behalf of a party or
  group of parties. To do so, it must specify:

    a. Which of its parties can be acted on behalf of;
    b. What actions can be taken;
    c. Who can take the actions; and
    d. Any conditions or limitations upon the actions. If any such
       limitations or conditions are inextricable, the actions CANNOT be used.

# 2.3 Contract Interpretation and Maintenance

Create a new power 2.6 rule, entitled "Interpreting Contracts",
with the following text:

  A contract should generally be interpreted according to its text, including
  any clauses giving directions for its interpretation or construction.
  Additionally, justice, the intent of the contract's parties, and the principles
  governing rule interpretation should be reasonably applied when interpreting
  a contract.

  A contract is subservient to the rules. Although a contract may specify
  obligations or powers beyond those created by the rules, a contract may not
  override the rules: in particular, any provision of a contract that would
  unreasonably violate an inalienable right of players and/or persons or
  cause any rule defined statement about the gamestate, or about the possibility
  of an action, to become false is void and without effect insofar as it does
  so.

  The following are protected actions:

  1. Registering and deregistering;
  2. Submitting, pending, or voting freely on a proposal, but only if the sole
     effect the proposal would have if adopted is to create, modify, or destroy
     a contract or group of contracts, or to cause an entity or group of
     entities to become or cease to be a contract or group of contracts;
  3. Creating, destroying, or amending a contract, intending to do so, and
     supporting, objecting to, or resolving such an intent, except where the
     mechanism for destruction or amendment is created by the contract
     itself;
  4. Making true statements about a contract;
  5. Calling, judging, assigning, or freely discussing a CFJ;
  6. Lawfully performing an official duty;
  7. Objecting to or supporting an intent to perform an action while
     Speaker;
  8. Using an executive order;
  9. Making, amending, revoking or calling in a pledge; and
  10. Any action affecting the status of a festival.


  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a contract CANNOT compel, forbid,
  or in any significant way alter, tamper with, or modify the performance of
  a protected action. A contract CANNOT punish a player for performing or
  failing protected action, or for doing so in a particular manner, except
  where it would otherwise be ILLEGAL. A contract also CANNOT enable a person to
  do any of the things prohibited to the contract by this paragraph. Insofar as
  a contract or a provision or clause of a contract contravenes the letter or
  clear intent of this rule, it is void and without effect.

Create a new power 2.4 rule, entitled "Sustenance Payments", with following
text:

  The Notary CAN, once a month, cause each contract that owns at least
  one shiny to transfer one shiny to Agora. E SHALL do so in the first week
  of every month. If a contract does not own at least one shiny, and is
  thus unable to make said payment, the Notary CAN and SHALL destroy
  it With Notice. If a contract becomes and remains able to pay before its
  destruction, the Notary CANNOT destroy it, and CAN and SHALL instead
  collect the shiny.

  The Notary CAN, by regulation, exempt a contract from the preceding paragraph.
  E SHALL NOT do so unless the contract seems to be in the public interest of
  Agora.


Create a new power 1.0 rule, entitled "The Notary", with the following text:

  The Notary is an office, and the recordkeepor of contracts. The Notary's
  weekly report contains all contracts, including their name, text, and
  parties. The Notary's weekly report also contains the list of private classes
  of asset. The Notary is ENCOURAGED to list all changes to the information e
  tracks in eir report.

Make o the Notary.

# 3.0 Asset Changes

Amend Rule 2166, "Assets", by changing it to read in full:

  An asset is an entity defined as such by a (a) rule, (b) authorized
  regulation, (c) group of rules and/or authorized regulations (but if such
  regulations modify a preexisting asset class defined by a rule or another
  title of regulations, they must be authorized specifically to do so by their
  parent rule), or (d) contract (hereafter its backing document), and existing
  solely because its backing document defines its existence. An asset's backing
  document can specify when and how that asset is created, destroyed, and
  transferred.

  Each asset has exactly one owner. If an asset would otherwise
  lack an owner, it is owned by Agora.  If an asset's backing document restricts
  its ownership to a class of entities, then that asset CANNOT be gained by or
  transferred to an entity outside that class, and is destroyed if it is owned
  by an entity outside that class (except if it is owned by Agora, in which case
  any player CAN transfer or destroy it without objection). The restrictions in
  the previous sentence are subject to modification by its backing document.

  Unless modified by an asset's backing document, ownership of an asset is
  restricted to Agora, players, and contracts. As an exception to the last
  sentence, non-player persons are generally able to own assets defined by
  a contract they are a party to, subject to modification by the contract in
  question.

  A contract's text can specify whether or not that contract is
  willing to receive assets or a class of assets. Generally, a contract CANNOT
  be given assets it is unwilling to receive. If the contract is silent on the
  matter, or if its willingness is indeterminate or the subject of a
  inextricable conditional, the procedure to determine its willingness is as
  follows:

    1. If the contract appears to anticipate being given assets, other than for
       sustenance (e.g. by authorizing parties to spend the contract's assets),
       then the contract is willing to receive all assets.
    2. Otherwise, it is unwilling to receive all assets.

  The previous paragraph (including the list) notwithstanding, a contract
  CAN be given 1 shiny a month for its sustenance payment, so long as
  it never has more than 1 shiny at a time.

  The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
  defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document. That
  entity's report includes a list of all instances of that class
  and their owners.  This portion of that entity's report is
  self-ratifying. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a contract CANNOT
  oblige a person who isn't a member to record its internal state, nor is
  the default recordkeepor responsible for tracking a contract's internal state.
  For the purposes of this rule, the promulgator of a regulation is bound by
  it.

  An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by
  announcement, subject to modification by its backing document. An
  indestructible asset is one defined as such by it backing document, and CANNOT
  be destroyed except by a rule, other than this one, specifically addressing
  the destruction of indestructible assets or that asset in particular; any
  other asset is destructible. In circumstances where another asset would be
  destroyed, an indestructible asset is generally transferred to Agora, subject
  to modification by its backing document and the intervention of other rules.

  To "lose" an asset is to have it destroyed from one's
  possession; to "revoke" an asset from an entity is to destroy it
  from that entity's possession.

  An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. paid, given) by announcement by
  its owner to another entity, subject to modification by its
  backing document. A fixed asset is one defined as such by its backing
  document, and CANNOT be transferred; any other asset is liquid.

  When a rule indicates transferring an amount that is not a natural number,
  the specified amount is rounded up to the nearest natural number.

  A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing document.
  Instances of a currency with the same owner are fungible.

  The "x balance of an entity", where x is a currency, is the number of x that
  entity possesses. If a rule, proposal, or other competent authority attempts
  to increase or decrease the balance of an entity without specifying a source
  or destination, then the currency is created or destroyed as needed.

  When a player causes one or more balances to change, e is ENCOURAGED
  to specify the resulting balance(s). Players SHOULD NOT specify
  inaccurate balances.

  Where it resolves ambiguity, the asset or currency being referred to is the
  currency designated as "Agora's official currency", if there is one.

  An asset or class of assets is private, rather than public, if its
  backing document is a contract.
