   someone decides they need this mechanic for anything, just reenact
   it. ]

[ COMMENT: The current way is a really roundabout way of doing it, in my
   opinion. I'm not sure if this is any better, to be honest, but
   I think it has some merit. ]

Amend Rule 1728 "Dependent Actions" by:
    replacing the following:
       2. If the action is to be performed Without N Objections, With N
          Agoran Consent, or With Notice, if the intent was announced at
          least 4 days earlier

       3. If the action is to be performed With T Notice, if the intent
          was announced at least T earlier.
    with:
       2. The intent was announced at least T earlier. If T is undefined,
          it is instead considered to be 4 days if the action is not With
          N Support; otherwise 0 days.

    and by renumbering the list accordingly.

Title: High-level asset verbs
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Trigon

[ COMMENT: This terminology is ripped from the coins rule and applies to
   all assets. I really like this one. ]

Amend Rule 2577 "Asset Actions" by replacing the second paragraph with
the following three paragraphs:
  For an entity to earn an asset is for that asset to be created in
  that entity's possession. To grant an entity an asset is to create
  it in eir possession.

  For an entity to lose an asset is for that asset to be destroyed
  from that entity's possession. To revoke an asset from an entity
  is to destroy it from that entity's possession.

  For entity A to take an asset from entity B is to transfer it from
  entity B to entity A.


Amend Rule 2559 "Paydays" by replacing its text with:
  Whenever a Payday occurs, the following events happen in order:

  1. Each player first earns 10 coins; then

  2. For each office, if a single player held that office for 16 or
    more days in the previous month and no unforgivable fines were
    levied on em for eir conduct in that office during that time,
    that player earns 5 coins.

  The occurrence of Paydays is secured.  At the beginning of each
  month, a Payday occurs.


Amend Rule 2499 "Welcome Packages" by replacing its text with:
  If a player has not received a Welcome Package since e most
  recently registered, any player CAN cause em to receive one by
  announcement.

  When a player receives a Welcome Package, e earns 10 coins.


Amend Rule 2555 "Blots" by replacing the paragraph beginning "To Lefy a
Fine" with:
  To Levy a Fine of N on a person, where N is a positive integer, is
  to grant em N blots. To expunge a blot is to destroy it.


Amend Rule 2583 "Earning Coins" by deleting the paragraph beginning "For
a player to".

Title: Reinstituting Rewards

Author: Trigon

[ COMMENT: For those of you who know that I really liked the rewards
   system from last year, this shouldn't come as a surprise. Now that
   there's no minigame, I think we should have a constant source for
   earning coins, so how about we tie it to general participation in the
   game? ]

Repeal Rule 2583 "Earning Coins"

Reenact Rule 2496 "Rewards" and replace its text with:
  A player CAN earn the set of assets associated with a reward
  condition exactly once in a timely fashion each time e fulfills it
  by stating how many assets e earns as a result of this action.

  Below is a list of reward conditions and their associated assets.

  * Being the author of an adopted proposal: a number of coins equal
   to ((the total strength of all valid ballots cast FOR the
  decision - the total strength of all valid ballots cast AGAINST)
  times the adoption index of the result) rounded up.

  * Judging a CFJ that e was assigned to: 5 coins.

  * Publishing a duty-fulfilling report: 5 coins. This reward can
   only be claimed once per office per week for a weekly report and
   once per office per month for a monthly report.

  * Having a Thesis pass peer-review and be granted a Degree based
   on its merit: 20 shinies


If a proposal by Trigon has not passed in the same distribution as this
proposal entitled "High-level asset verbs", amend rule 2496 by replacing
all instances of the word "earn" with "create in eir possession".

WHEREAS the FLR is the most complete record of Agora's rules;
WHEREAS the copy of the Ruleset posted on the Agoran website is thus a form
  of the FLR;
WHEREAS Players, Observers, and Other Interested Parties go to Agora's website
  for the most accurate and current information about the rules;

  SLR (i.e. once a week);

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that it is THE WILL OF AGORA that the Honorable
Rulekeepor update the main ruleset linked from the Agoran website each time
e releases an SLR, and that e additionally post a copy of the official FLR
on the website.
