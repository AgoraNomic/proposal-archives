Official Proposal


Re-enact Rule 1650 (Silliness) with the following text:

  Each Nomic Week a Player is designated the Silly Person.  The Silly Person
  SHALL in that week, by announcement (1) designate another player, who has not
  been the Silly Person in the past two weeks, to be the next week's Silly
  Person; (2) submit a Silly Proposal.  If there is ever no Silly Person or the
  Silly Person is not a player, then the next week's Silly Person is the first
  player that any player publicly designates to be the next week's Silly Person.

  A Silly Proposal is a Proposal whose sole contents are one of
  the following:
    i) A limerick.
   ii) A rhymed poem no longer than fourteen lines. (No free
       verse!)
  iii) A joke of no more than a hundred words.
   iv) A truly hideous pun.

  The first Silly Proposal submitted by the week's Silly Person is an Official
  Proposal.


[I want to reward the Silly Person a shiny, but we have that dumb limit that
rewards can only be defined in R2445, and the Fearmongor rule may not allow me
to include other rules in the proposal].

[For Rulekeepor, given history of Rule 1650:

Text in square brackets in this proposal is only an annotation and this
Proposal's effect is as if that text were not included at all.

[Changes from the proto:
  - Added these annotations.
  - Reordered the rule changes to make a bit more sense.
  - Added the codification of the "you make it, you fill it" principle.
  - Made it so the current holder of an office can initiate an election
    for it by announcement.
  - Added provision for uncontested elections.
  - Increased pragmaticism.
  - Added essential parameters to Campaign Proposals.
  - A few other minor fixes.
]

Amend rule 1006 (Offices) by adding the following paragraph before the
final one:

  A holder of an elected office who did not become its holder by winning an
  election, and has not won an election for that office since, is an interim
  holder. An elected office that is either vacant or has an interim holder is an
  interim office.

[This definition is used in election initiations, below. Basically, an interim
holder is one who doesn't have a solid claim to hold onto the office, and
vacancy is included in the definition of an interim office to avoid righting
"if the office's holder is interim or if the office is vacant" everywhere.]

Amend rule 1006 (Offices) by adding the following paragraph at the end:

  When a proposal takes effect and creates a new office, if the
  proposal does not specify otherwise, the author of that proposal
  becomes the holder of the office.

[This codifies the "If you make an office, it's your job to fill it if no-one
else does." principle. Note that the holder of an office installed this way is
interim.]

Enact a new rule entitled (Campaign Proposals, with power 3), reading as
follows:

  During the nomination period of an election, any candidate for that election
  CAN submit a Campaign Proposal for that election, provided e does not
  currently have a pending Campaign Proposal for that election, using the normal
  mechanism for proposal submission. Campaign Proposals SHOULD relate to the
  duties of the office up for election. Commitment is an untracked Campaign
  Proposal switch with values Committed (default) and Uncommitted. The author
  of a Committed proposal may flip it to Uncommitted by announcement.

[A Campaign Proposal is basically an extension of a candidate's platform,
allowing them to propose changes to any office that they wish to associate with
their election.

Commitment is basically stating whether a candidate wishes to be elected only
if their proposal passes. They can opt out of commitment, so that they can be
elected if it fails. This allows a player to encode "I will take this office
only if I can change it in this fashion." into the election system.]

  A Campaign Proposal is an Official Proposal exempt from automatic
  distribution, and SHALL NOT be distributed as required by the rules.
  The election with which a Campaign Proposal is associated, as well as its
  Commitment, are essential parameters for an Agoran decision to adopt a
  Campaign Proposal.

[The election procedure dictates when Campaign Proposals should be
distributed; they don't follow the normal distribution system. They also
have some additional essential parameters, although note that a player
can opt out of Commitment even after the proposal is distributed.]

  When a Campaign Proposal is adopted, it CANNOT take effect until
  the associated election ends. When the election ends, if the winner was the
  proposal's author, then any player CAN once make it take effect by
  announcement (with its power set as usual for an adopted proposal). If the
  conditions for a Campaign Proposal to take effect are met as a result of an
  action in a public message, the author of the message SHALL make it take
  effect in that message.

[Campaign Proposals need to meet two requirements in order to take effect:
their author must win the election and they must pass. The former is what ties
them to the election and allows candidates to safely submit conflicting
proposals. The latter is the safety guard (reinforced by rule 106 which
prevents non-adopted proposals from taking effect) to ensure that a candidate can

This also means that voters can vote on the Campaign Proposals based on
whether or not they would be okay with the rule changes, knowing that
the actual choice of which one takes effect is dictated by the election
outcome.

Requiring them to take effect by announcement is a safety guard to
ensure that they don't take effect with no one noticing. In practice,
the Assessor will nearly always do this in the same message as resolving
the decision (and the poll, if applicable), however.]

Amend rule 1607 (Distribution) by replacing
  "In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL, as part of eir weekly duties,
  distribute all pending proposals."
with
  "In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL, as part of eir weekly duties,
  distribute all pending proposals except for those exempted from automatic
  distribution by other rules."

[This ensures that the Promotor isn't obligated to distribute Campaign
Proposals normally.]

Amend rule 2154 (Election Procedure) to read as follows:
  A player CAN initiate an election for a specified office:
      a) With 2 Support, if either the office is interim or the
         most recent election for that office was resolved more
         than 90 days prior, and provided that the initiator
         becomes a candidate in the same message.
      b) By announcement, if e is the ADoP and if the office is
         interim, or if e is the holder of that office.
  The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be
  initiated if one is already in progress.

[This cleans up when elections can start. Basically, anyone can
challenge the existing officer if they are interim or if they have been
in their office for a long time; the ADoP can open an election for an
office that needs one; and the current officer can always open
competition for the office.]

  After an election is initiated and until nominations close, any player CAN
  become a candidate by announcement. A candidate ceases to be a candidate if e
  ceases to be a player during the election. An election is contested if it has
  two or more candidates at the end of the nomination period, and uncontested
  otherwise. For a contested election, nominations close at the end of the
  poll's voting period. For an uncontested election, nominations close at the
  end of the nomination period.

[Players must explicitly opt-in to become candidates, and can do so up until
the winner is locked in, effectively.]

  When an election is initiated, it enters the nomination period,
  which lasts for 7 days. In a timely fashion after the nomination
  period ends, the ADoP CAN and SHALL, in the same message:
      1) If the election is contested, initiate an Agoran decision
         to select the winner of the election (the poll). For this
         decision, the Vote Collector is the Assessor, the valid
         options are the candidates for that election (including
         those who become candidates after its initiation), and the
         voting method is instant runoff.
      2) Distribute all pending Campaign Proposals associated
         with the election.
      3) If POSSIBLE per the following paragraph, end the election
         immediately.

[After the nomination period, the ADoP kicks off the election by both starting
the election poll (if needed) and distributing its Campaign Proposals. The
Assessor is the vote collector for the poll because that seemed less invasive
than forcing the ADoP to be vote collector for the proposals.]

  If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate, and that
  candidate either is not the author of a Committed Campaign Proposal for that
  election or that proposal was adopted, then any player CAN declare them the
  winner of the election by announcement. If at any point an uncontested
  election has no candidates, or a single candidate who is the author of a
  failed Committed Campaign Proposal for that election, then any player CAN
  declare the election ended with no winner by announcement. The Assessor SHALL
  do one or the other in the same message in which e resolves a decision to
  adopt a Campaign Proposal for an ongoing uncontested election.

[This paragraph is a bit of a doozy, but basically it means that uncontested
elections work the way you think: if there are no candidates, they end, and if
there is only won, they win. The complexity comes from the fact that if the one
candidate has a Committed Proposal, then things must wait until it concludes,
although they can flip it to Uncommitted and then end the election themselves.

No provision is made for contested elections where all but one candidate has
dropped out, since I didn't want to have to write rules to allow cancellation
of Agoran decisions.]

  A poll CANNOT be resolved until the decisions to adopt all associated Campaign
  Proposals are resolved. When resolving the poll, if a given candidate authored
  one of the associated Campaign Proposals, that proposal is Committed, and it
  was not adopted, then that player is disqualified.

[This provides that a player with a Committed proposal that failed is
not permitted to win the election, as part the intent of Commitment.]

  When the poll is resolved, its outcome, if a player, wins the election. When
  a player wins an election, e is installed into the associated office and the
  election ends.

Amend rule 955 (Determining the Will of Agora) by appending "The rule providing
for an Agoran Decision by instant runoff may disqualify one or more options; in
such a case, they are eliminated prior to beginning the first stage of the vote
count."

[Enabling of disqualification.]

Amend rule 2138 (The Associate Director of Personnel) by replacing the
bullet:
  2. The date on which the most recent election for each office
     was initiated.
with:
  2. The current status of the ongoing election for that office
     or, if there is no ongoing election for that office, the
     date on which the last election ended
  3. For filled elected offices, whether or not the holder is
     interim.

[Since the actually relevant date for election timing is when the most
recent election ended, not started, this changes the reporting to
the election has no candidates, end it per the following paragraph.account for
that. Likewise, interim office-holders should be marked so it is easy to know
when elections can be started.]

Amend rule 2472 (Office Incompatibilities) by replacing "Promotor and
ADoP" with "Assessor and ADoP".

[The Promotor and ADoP don't interact at all, but now, the ADoP
distributes proposals. As a result, they should be kept apart from
Assessor for the same reason as Promotor.]
