Title: another device defect
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: G.
Co-author(s):


Amend Rule 2655 by replacing:
  responsible for building and maintaining the Device.
with:
  responsible for building, tracking, and maintaining the Device.

and by deleting:
  This intent announcement counts as the Mad Engineers's
  weekly report.

[with the reporting duty for the device status added, by default a weekly
switch value report, we no longer need this intent to count as a report to
get the weekly report reward.  The intent is still part of "weekly duties"
but not the report.]

Title: Forgiveness is a process
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: G.
Co-author(s): nix


The patent title Fugitive is hereby revoked from every person who
holds it.

Henceforth, the Herald SHOULD NOT list people as being "fugitives" in eir
reporting.  [covers any "unofficial" listees who didn't have patent titles].

[note: this may be slightly more controversial than last time, given that
we've uncovered some of those listed actually hold patent titles, and we
generally don't revoke those in order to preserve history. For full
disclosure, who actually holds that title could be reconstructed in a
fairly straightforward manner (I think I found the requisite proposal
records), if the consensus is to keep the patent title holders in the
Scroll].
