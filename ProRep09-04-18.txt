Author: D Margaux

Title: Slow your quorum v1.1
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Murphy
Co-authors: Oerjan


Amend Rule 879 (Quorum) by replacing this text:

       The quorum that an Agoran Decision gains as it is created can be
       defined by other rules of power 2 or greater. If no other rule
       defines the quorum of an Agoran Decision, the quorum for that
       decision is equal to the number of players who voted on the Agoran
       Decision to adopt a proposal that had been most recently resolved
       at the time of that decision's initiation, minus 2.

with this text:

       The quorum that an Agoran Decision gains as it is created can be
       defined by other rules of power 2 or greater. If no other rule
       defines the quorum of an Agoran Decision, the quorum for that
       decision is equal to 2.

Create a rule titled "Baseline Quorum" with Power = 2 and this text:

       Baseline Quorum is a switch, tracked by the Promotor, with values
       equal to the positive integers and default value 1. When an Agoran
       Decision is created, it gains quorum equal to Baseline Quorum.

       Target Quorum is N - 2, where N is the number of players who voted
       on the most recently resolved Agoran Decision to adopt a proposal.

       Once per week, the Promotor CAN increase or decrease Baseline
       Quorum by 1 by announcement, and SHALL do so as follows:

         a) If Baseline Quorum < Target Quorum, then increase it.

         b) If Baseline Quorum > Target Quorum, then decrease it.

         c) If Baseline Quorum = Target Quorum, then announce it. E need
            not change it that week.

Set Baseline Quorum equal to what Target Quorum would have been
immediately before the adoption of this proposal, if it had been
defined as above.
