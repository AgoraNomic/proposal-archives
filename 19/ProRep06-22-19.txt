Title: auctions have fees
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: G.
Co-authors:


[The payment rule for auctions just says that if you happen to have an
auction debt, if you pay Agora under any circumstances, it triggers
stuff.  This means, if someone happens to have two auction debts, they
can make one payment and it would count for both.  This brings things
into line.]

Amend Rule 2551 (Auction End) by replacing:
  The winner of a lot SHALL pay the Auctioneer the number of the
  Auction's currency equal to eir bid, in a single payment, in a
  timely fashion.
with:
  The winner of the lot SHALL, in a timely fashion, pay a fee (the
  number of the Auction's currency equal to eir bid) to the
  Auctioneer in order to satisfy eir auction debt.

[This makes "satisfying eir auction debt" a fee-based action governed
under R2579, which didn't exist when the auction rules were written.
R2579 then takes care of the various CANs and method details.  The
transfer of the lots is then a consequence of "satisfying eir auction
debt"].

Title: Timeline Control Ordnance v2
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors:


Enact a new power 3.1 Rule, entitled "Timelines", with the following text:

  A timeline is a temporal sequence of events and states.

  The Objective Timeline is the timeline of matters as they actually happened.
  On the Objective Timeline, the consequences of an event are determined
  based on the conditions actually in effect, under Agoran law, when that event
  occurred. The Objective Timeline is not part of the gamestate; instead, it
  is the recording of events on reality itself, and changing it retroactively
  without actual time travel is thus IMPOSSIBLE, rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding.

  The Standard Timeline is the timeline used for the purposes of ordinary
  gameplay. By default, the Standard Timeline is defined by events and their
  consequences in the same way that the Objective Timeline is. However,
  the Standard Timeline is part of the gamestate. Accordingly, it can be
  modified retroactively; such retroactive modifications are secured
  at power 3.

  Attempted retroactive changes are to be interpreted as attempts to change the
  Standard Timeline. All changes are to be interpreted as prospective unless
  they are explicitly retroactive.

  By default, any entity with a power less than the power of this rule that
  refers to the past, present, or future is to be interpreted as referring to
  the Standard Timeline; however, entities may explicitly reference
  different timelines.

Amend Rule 1551, "Ratification" by changing the text "the gamestate is modified"
to read "the gamestate is retroactively modified".

Amend Rule 591, "Delivering Judgements", by changing the text

  "The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
  the facts and legal situation at the time the inquiry case was
  initiated, not taking into account any events since that time:"

to read

  "The judgement of an inquiry case should be based on the facts and legal
  situation as they objectively existed at the time the inquiry case was
  initiated, not taking into account any events or retroactive modifications
  since that time.

  The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows:"
