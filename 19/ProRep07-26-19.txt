[This is one of the most complicated distributions in my time in office.
 There will be errors; CoE and I'll try to correct. I've been working at this

 Sorry y'all; I tried.]

I hereby distribute each listed proposal, initiating the Agoran
Decision of whether to adopt it, and removing it from the proposal

quorum is 9, the voting method is AI-majority, and the valid
options are FOR and AGAINST (PRESENT is also a valid vote, as are
conditional votes).

Title: recusal simplification
Adoption index: 1.7
Author: G.
Co-authors:


Amend Rule 591 (Delivering Judgements) by deleting the following text:
  If e does not, the Arbitor CAN remove em from being the judge of that
  case by announcement, and SHALL do so in a timely fashion after the time
  limit expires, unless the judge assigns a valid judgement in the
  mean time.


Amend Rule 2492 (Recusal) to read in full:

  A judge CAN recuse emself from a CFJ e is assigned to, by
  announcement.

  The Arbitor CAN recuse a judge from a case by announcement, if that
  judge has violated a time limit for judging the case and has not
  judged it in the mean time; the Arbitor SHALL do so in a timely
  fashion after the time limit expires, if able.

  If a judge is recused from a case 4+ days after being assigned
  to it, e SHOULD NOT be assigned as a judge until e has apologised
  and or reasonably explained eir actions.


[
- General rewording goes from 12 to 9 lines of text; net -3 lines in
the ruleset.

- It was weird that recusing oneself from a CFJ made one ineligible
to judge for a week, but being recused for lateness didn't.  There
are also honorable reasons to self-recuse (e.g. self-interest in the
case).  Changed this to the idea of "if you're recused in any way after
being assigned 4+ days, let us know why, before getting another case",
and only governed by a SHOULD.  It's as much about helping the Arbitor
figure out if the recused are still interested in judging.

  2. The action is to be performed With N support, and there are fewer

Title: Cancelling Proposals (arr. for violin)
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jacob Arduino
Co-authors: twg, G.


[ This has bugged me for a while (no pun intended): if a broken proposal makes
   it to its voting period, even if the error is then discovered, it tends not
   to percolate through to everyone doing the voting, and the proposal gets
   adopted anyway. I've been trying to get around this by just endorsing the
   proposal's author, on the basis that e's the most likely to notice if there
   is a problem and can then change eir vote to AGAINST, but that has its own
   problems. I feel this is a fairly neat solution with enough safeguards to
   stop it being abused. ]

[ This second version removes reliance on the Assessor to support the action,
  and adds protection against the Speaker's delay (which would function here
  as a veto). ]

Enact a new rule, "Cancelling Erroneous Proposals", Power=3.0, with the
following text:

  During the voting period of an Agoran decision determining whether or not
  to adopt a proposal, its author CAN with support cancel the decision.

  It is RECOMMENDED that this ability only be used if the proposal contains
  a textual error preventing it from having the effect its author intended.

  The Speaker is not eligible to object to an announcement of intent to
  perform an action permitted by this rule.

Amend Rule 955, "Determining the Will of Agora", by adding the following list
item to the unnumbered list in between the two previously existing items:

  - If the decision has been cancelled, as permitted by rules of power 3 or
    greater, the outcome is instead CANCELLED.

appropriate penalty. I expect em to expunge all three approximately by
