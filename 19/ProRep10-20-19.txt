Title: Clarify salary
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Murphy
Co-authors: G., Jason Cobb


Amend Rule 2559 (Paydays) by replacing this text:

  2. For each office, if a single player held that office for 16 or
     more days in the previous month and no unforgivable fines were
     levied on em for eir conduct in that office during that time,
     that player earns 5 coins.

     more days in the previous month and no unforgivable fines were
     levied on em during that month for eir conduct in that office,
     that player earns 5 coins.

[Legislates based on the judgement of CFJ 3774, but also covers edge
cases like "do something in late September, get dinged for it in early
October": you still earn your salary for September, but forfeit it for
October. Covering corner cases like "exit office in early October,
no October salary to forfeit, impose fine/debt against September salary"
is left as an exercise for future proposal authors.]

Amend Rule 2152 ("Mother, May I?") by replacing the text "CAN:" with the
text "CAN, POSSIBLE:".

["POSSIBLE" is used in the Rules right now, but is never defined; this
defines it.]

Title: Possibly-Indeterminate Switches
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason Cobb
Co-authors:


Amend Rule 2162 ("Switches") by replacing the paragraph beginning "If an
action or set of actions" with the following:

  If a type of switch is not explicitly designated as
  possibly-indeterminate by the rule that defines it, and if an action
  or set of actions would cause the value of an instance of that type
  of switch to become indeterminate, that instance instead takes on
  its last determinate and possible value, if any, otherwise it takes
  on its default value.

[Provides an escape hatch so that rules can allow their switches to have
indeterminate values. This has come up in protos by both me and
Falsifian. It is useful to have these possibly-indeterminate properties
be switches, since switches have useful properties and precedent, so the
always-determinate system cuts off some use-cases.]

Title: Yes, Prime Minister
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Murphy
Co-authors: Gaelan


Amend Rule 2193 (The Registrar) by removing this text:

  The Registrar is also responsible for tracking any switches,
  defined in a rule, that would otherwise lack an officer to track
  them, unless the switch is defined as untracked.

Amend Rule 2423 (First Among Equals) by appending this text:

  The Prime Minister is responsible for tracking any switches
  defined by the rules, not defined as untracked, and not defined
  as tracked by another officer.

Title: The Fat Director

Author: Murphy

Amend Rule 2193 (The Registrar) by removing this text:

  The Registrar is also responsible for tracking any switches,
  defined in a rule, that would otherwise lack an officer to track
  them, unless the switch is defined as untracked.

Amend Rule 2423 (First Among Equals) by removing this text:

  The Prime Minister is responsible for tracking any switches
  defined by the rules, not defined as untracked, and not defined
  as tracked by another officer.

Create a rule titled "The Fat Director" with Power 2 and this text:

  The Fat Director is an imposed office.

  A loose switch is a switch defined by the rules, not defined as
  untracked, and not defined as tracked by an officer other than the
  Fat Director. The Fat Director is responsible for tracking any
  loose switches.

  When a proposal creates a loose switch or causes a switch to
  become loose, the Fat Director is set to the author of that
  proposal. If the Fat Director is vacant and any loose switches
  exist, then the Registrar CAN set the Fat Director to any player
  by announcement. Any player CAN become the Fat Director by
  announcement.

[Would have called it "Fat Controllor", but that would be too close
to "Comptrollor", and I didn't want to merge it with that either.]

Enact a new Rule of Power 3.0 with the text:

  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding:

    * the Rulekeepor's reports NEED NOT include this rule or any
      information about it;

    * the Rulekeepor NEED NOT assign this rule a title;

    * players SHALL NOT clearly identify this rule - doing so is the
      Class 1 Crime of Uttering the Forbidden Name.

   Any player CAN, without objection, exorcise this rule (cause it to
   repeal itself).

/* Changes from Murphy's version: added "any information about it" (like
 * annotations, etc) to the list of things the Rulekeepor doesn't have to
 * publish; added an extra safety so that we can get rid of it quickly if
 * necessary.
 */

/* Changes from my first version: increased to Power 3 to overrule reporting
 * requirements; removed the Rulekeepor's requirement to assign a title without
 * identifying it; added an explicit SHALL NOT to Uttering the Forbidden Name;
 * moved the SHALL NOT to within the RttCN clause to overrule the requirement
 * for freedom of speech.

Title: Clean up your own mess, without making a bigger one

Remove the following paragraph from Rule 2139 “The Registrar”: {
  The Registrar is also responsible for tracking any switches,
  defined in a rule, that would otherwise lack an officer to track
  them, unless the switch is defined as untracked.
}

Create a power-1 rule titled “Switch Responsibility” with the following text: {
  For each switch which would otherwise lack an officer to track it, and is
  not defined as untracked, there exists an imposed office named
  “Tracker of [switch name]” that is responsible for tracking that switch.
}

[1006/44 states:
     When a proposal takes effect and creates a new office, if the
     proposal does not specify otherwise, the author of that proposal
     becomes the holder of the office.

I think this works, but we might need to clarify the meaning of
“creates a new office” to be sure.]

Amend rule 2496 by replacing the current text {

  * Publishing an office's weekly or monthly report, provided that
    publication was the first report published for that office in
    the relevant time period (week or month respectively) to fulfill
    an official weekly or monthly duty: 5 coins.

} with the text {

  * Publishing an office's weekly or monthly report, provided that
    publication was the first report published for that office in
    the relevant time period (week or month respectively) to fulfill
    an official weekly or monthly duty: 3 coins for an interim office
    or 5 coins for any other office.

}

Reasoning: This should encourage elections for offices. Elections are Fun
and Cool and help spread the workload and reduce consolidation.
