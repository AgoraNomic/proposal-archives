Title: auctions have fees
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: G.
Co-authors:


[The payment rule for auctions just says that if you happen to have an
auction debt, if you pay Agora under any circumstances, it triggers
stuff.  This means, if someone happens to have two auction debts, they
can make one payment and it would count for both.  This brings things
into line.]

Amend Rule 2551 (Auction End) by replacing:
  The winner of a lot SHALL pay the Auctioneer the number of the
  Auction's currency equal to eir bid, in a single payment, in a
  timely fashion.
with:
  The winner of the lot SHALL, in a timely fashion, pay a fee (the
  number of the Auction's currency equal to eir bid) to the
  Auctioneer in order to satisfy eir auction debt.

[This makes "satisfying eir auction debt" a fee-based action governed
under R2579, which didn't exist when the auction rules were written.
R2579 then takes care of the various CANs and method details.  The
transfer of the lots is then a consequence of "satisfying eir auction
debt"].

Title: Timeline Control Ordnance v2
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: omd, Jason Cobb


Enact a new power 3.1 Rule, entitled "Timelines", with the following text:

  A timeline is a temporal sequence of events and states.

  The Objective Timeline is the timeline of matters as they actually happened.
  On the Objective Timeline, the consequences of an event are determined
  based on the conditions actually in effect, under Agoran law, when that event
  occurred. The Objective Timeline is not part of the gamestate; instead, it
  is the recording of events on reality itself, and changing it retroactively
  without actual time travel is thus IMPOSSIBLE, rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding.

  The Standard Timeline is the timeline used for the purposes of ordinary
  gameplay. By default, the Standard Timeline is defined by events and their
  consequences in the same way that the Objective Timeline is. However,
  the Standard Timeline is part of the gamestate. Accordingly, it can be
  modified retroactively; such retroactive modifications are secured
  at power 3.

  Attempted retroactive changes are to be interpreted as attempts to change the
  Standard Timeline. All changes are to be interpreted as prospective unless
  they are explicitly retroactive.

  By default, any entity with a power less than the power of this rule that
  refers to the past, present, or future is to be interpreted as referring to
  the Standard Timeline; however, entities may explicitly reference
  different timelines.

Amend Rule 1551, "Ratification" by changing the text "the gamestate is modified"
to read "the gamestate is retroactively modified".

Amend Rule 591, "Delivering Judgements", by changing the text

  "The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
  the facts and legal situation at the time the inquiry case was
  initiated, not taking into account any events since that time:"

to read

  "The judgement of an inquiry case should be based on the facts and legal
  situation as they objectively existed at the time the inquiry case was
  initiated, not taking into account any events or retroactive modifications
  since that time.

  The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows:"

In Rule 2557, replace the first paragraph with:

  When the rules authorize an investigator to impose the Cold Hand
  of Justice for a violation, e CAN do so by levying a fine of B on
  the perp by announcement, within the following guidelines:

and add a new list item at the start of the list (that is, right after
the first paragraph), with the text:

  - B is at least 1 and at most twice the base value of the
    violation.

Retitle Rule 2557 to "Sentencing Guidelines".

[Comment: Rule 2557 is currently titled "Removing Blots". When I tried
to understand why, I noticed that the 2018-04-07 SLR lists two Rule
2557s, one of which actually is about removing blots, and the other of
which is titled "Sentencing Guidelines". The next SLR I could find is
published much later, 2018-10-14, and has R2557 in or close to its
current form. I don't know exactly what happened there.]

Title: Regulated actions reform (v2)
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason Cobb
Co-authors: Aris, omd, G., Falsifian


[Comment: see proto thread for changes and rationales.]


Amend Rule 2493 ("Regulations") as follows:

  Append the following text to the first paragraph: "Regulations are
  binding."


Amend Rule 1742 ("Contracts") as follows:

  Append the following sentence to the first paragraph: "Contracts are
  binding."


Amend Rule 2125 ("Regulated Actions") to read:

  An entity is binding if and only if the Rules designate it as such.
  The Rules as a whole is an entity that is binding; this entity is
  known as the ruleset.

  An action is regulated by a binding entity if: (1) the entity
  directly and explicitly defines, limits, allows, enables, permits,
  forbids, or requires its performance; (2) the entity describes the
  circumstances under which the action would succeed or fail; or (3)
  the action would, as part of its effect, modify information for
  which the entity requires some player to be a "recordkeepor".

  When a binding entity explicitly defines an action, describes the
  possibility of performing an action, or describes the methods by
  which an action can be performed, it creates an action that is
  distinct from all other actions; the binding entity is said to "own"
  this created action. A binding entity CAN only state that it
  requires or forbids an action that it does not own; it CANNOT modify
  any other properties of the action.

  An action that is owned by a binding entity CAN only be performed as
  described by the entity, and only using the methods explicitly
  specified in the entity for performing the given action.
  Interpretations that result in the entity directly proscribing
  actions that are not regulated by it are invalid.


Retitle Rule 2125 to "Binding Entities".

Set the power of Rule 2125 to 3.1.
