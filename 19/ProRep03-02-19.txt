Title: Dependent Action Cleanup Act
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: D Margaux
Co-authors: Gaelan


Retitle Rule 1728 to “Dependent Action Methods.”

Amend Rule 1728 to replace its entire text with the following:

{

The following methods of taking actions are known as "dependent actions":

1. Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer no greater than 8
("Without Objection" is shorthand for this method with N = 1);

2. With N Support, where N is a positive integer ("With Support" is shorthand
for this method with N = 1);

3. With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1 with a minimum
of 1 ("With Agoran Consent" is shorthand for this method with N = 1);

4. With Notice; or

5. With T Notice, where T is a time period.

N is 1 unless otherwise specified.

}

Enact a new rule (power=3) entitled “Performing a Dependent Action” with this
text:

{

A rule that purports to allow a person (the performer) to perform an action by
a set of one or more dependent actions identified in Rule 1728 thereby
allows em
to perform the action by announcement if all of the following are true:

1. A person (the initiator) published an announcement of intent that
unambiguously, clearly, conspicuously, and without obfuscation specified
the action intended to be taken and the method(s) to be used;

2.  The announcement referenced in paragraph (1) of this Rule
unambiguously, clearly, conspicuously, and without obfuscation states:

     * the value of T, if the action is to be taken with T Notice; and

     * the value of N, if N is not equal to 1 and the action is to be taken
       Without N Objections, With N Support, or With N Agoran Consent;

3. The announcement referenced in paragraph (1) of this Rule was published:

    * within the 14 days preceding the action, if the action is to be
      performed With N Support;

    * between 4 and 14 days preceding the action, if the action is to be
      performed Without N Objections, With N Agoran Consent, or With Notice;
      or

    * between T and 14 days preceding the action, if the action is to be
      performed With T Notice;

4. At least one of the following is true:

    * the performer is the initiator;

    * the initiator was authorized to perform the action due to holding a
      rule-defined position now held by the performer; or

    * the initiator is authorized to perform the action, the action
      depends on support, the performer has supported the intent, and the
      rule authorizing the performance does not explicitly prohibit supporters
      from performing it;

5. Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by other Rules; and

6. The conditions are all met, if any conditions were stated in the
announcement of intent referenced in paragraph (1) of this Rule.

The performer SHOULD publish a list of supporters and objectors if the
action is to
be taken with N Agoran Consent.

  The Ritual MUST be performed at least once in every Agoran week.
  If The Ritual was performed at least once in the previous Agoran

Title: line-item veto 2.02
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: G.
Co-authors:


Enact a Rule, "Line-item Veto", with the following text:

  The Comptrollor is an imposed office.  When the office is vacant,
  the ADoP CAN, by announcement, set the Comptrollor to a player
  chosen at random from the set of current Officers, excepting any
  player who was most recently the Comptrollor.  The ADoP SHALL do
  so in a timely fashion after the office becomes vacant.

  When the Comptrollor office has been held for the same player for
  30 days, it becomes vacant.

  A Notice of Veto is a body of text, published by the Comptrollor,
  clearly, directly, and without obfuscation labelled within the
  publishing message as being a Notice of Veto.

  When a Comptrollor publishes a Notice of Veto, the office of
  Comptrollor becomes vacant.

  If the text of a Notice of Veto clearly indicates certain
  provisions within specified Proposals as being vetoed, and the
  voting period for a decision to adopt the proposal is ongoing
  when the Notice is published, then the provisions are vetoed.
  For the purposes of this Rule, each individual change specified
  within a proposal's text is a "provision".

  Vetoed provisions in a proposal are prohibited from being applied
  when the proposal takes effect (that is, that part of the
  proposal's effect CANNOT be applied).

    Power; otherwise,

    type of Rule including the Rule with the lower Power), and this
    does not lead to contradictions between them, in which case such
    provisions shall be used to resolve the conflict; otherwise,
