ID: 8152
Title: Justice Reenactment
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: G.
Co-authors:


Re-enact Rule 2246 (name at repeal: Submitting a CFJ to the Justiciar),
at Power-2, and the following text:

  When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e CAN, optionally,
  submit it to the Referee by announcement. All persons are
  ENCOURAGED to submit a case to the Referee only when there is a
  good reason not to let it be processed by the Arbitor as usual.

  When a CFJ is submitted to the Referee, the Referee receives all
  obligations and powers for the specific case that the Arbitor
  would otherwise receive due to being Arbitor.  This takes
  precedence over Rules that would otherwise assign duties and
  powers regarding a judicial case to the Arbitor.


Retitle Rule 2246 to "Submitting a CFJ to the Referee".

Amend Rule 2591, "Spaceships", by changing the text "Armour (an
integer switch limited to values from 0 to 10 inclusive)" to "Armour
(an integer switch limited to values less than or equal to 10)" and
by changing the text 'A Spaceship with an Armour of 0 is "Defeated"'
to 'A Spaceship with an Armour of 0 or less is "Defeated"'.

[There are other ways to patch this, but I feel this is more elegant.
 If anybody else prefers a different solution, feel free to propose
 it.]

Title: The Duumvirate v.1.2
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: D Margaux
Co-authors: G.


Enact a power 3 rule entitled "The Duumvirate" with the following text:

{
The Duumvirate is an organization whose members are D. Margaux and G.
Each member of the Duumvirate is a "Dictator."

Either Dictator CAN by announcement cause this Rule to repeal itself.

No person can act on behalf of a Dictator (other than the Dictator acting as
emself).

A Decree is a document clearly labeled as such. Either Dictator CAN proclaim a
Decree with support from the other Dictator.

When a Decree is proclaimed, then:

     (1)  its power is set to 3;

     (2)  it takes effect by applying to the gamestate the changes specified
          in the text of the Decree, to the greatest extent permitted by the
          rules; and then,

     (3) its power is set to 0.

Title: Justice Favour Adjustments
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: D Margaux
Co-authors:


[[Comment: This proposal fixes a mistaken reference to “cards,” requires the
Referee to act in a timely fashion, and increases the reward to encourage a
little more finger pointing, which I find to be an entertaining part of the
game.]]

Amend Rule 2542 to replace:

  {When a player's Finger-Pointing leads to a Card award, or when the Referee
  issues Summary Judgement, the Referee shall award a Favour in the Party
  holding Justice to the responsible player.}

With:
  {When a player's Finger-Pointing results in a player being fined one or more
  blots, or when the Referee issues Summary Judgement, the Referee SHALL in a
  timely fashion award 2 Favours in the Party holding Justice to the responsible
  player.}

Title: Extend "amend" and "reenact"
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Trigon
Co-authors: Ørjan


[ Comment: I stole Ørjan's wording for the third bullet point under
   reenactments and I got rid of all instances of "re-enact", opting for
   the nonhyphenated version. I also changed the title slightly. ]

Amend Rule 105 (Power=3) 'Rule Changes' by removing items 3-6 in the
ordered list and then adding to that list:

  3. reenact a rule. A repealed rule not in the ruleset identified
     by its most recent rule number MUST be specified for
     reenactment. The rule's properties are to be set as follows:

    * its ID number will be the same as it was when the rule was
      most recently repealed.

    * its change identifier will be one more than its change
      identifier when it was most recently repealed.

    * Each of its text, power and title shall be as provided by the
      reenacting instrument, or if not provided, the same as when
      it was most recently repealed, with power defaulting to 1 if
      it had none. The rule SHOULD have materially the same purpose
      as did the repealed version.

    If the reenacting instrument is incapable of setting the
    reenacted rule's power to that value, then the reenactment is
    INEFFECTIVE.

  4. amend a rule. This may include changing the rule's text, name,
     or power.
