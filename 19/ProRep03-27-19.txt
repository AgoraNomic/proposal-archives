ID: 8174
Title: Understated
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: G.

Amend Rule 2496 (Rewards) by replacing:
       A player CAN earn the set of assets associated with a reward
       condition exactly once in a timely fashion each time e fulfills it
       by stating how many assets e earns as a result of this action.
with:
       A player CAN, by announcement, earn the set of assets associated
       with a reward condition exactly once in a timely fashion each time
       e fulfills it, provided the announcement specifies the action that
       e performed and the amount of assets e earns as a result.

[in addition to putting in the 'by announcement', use of the term
'specify' invokes the same standard as in R478 that (by precedent)
allows for shorthand, references, quanging, etc.]
