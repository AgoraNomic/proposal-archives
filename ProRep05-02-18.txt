Amend Rule 2562, Facility Ranks, to read as follows:

  Rank is a secured facility switch tracked by the Cartographor defaulting
  to 1, with possible values of all positive integers.

  A player CAN increase the rank of a facility that is at eir location by
  exactly 1 by announcement by paying any upgrade costs of the facility for
  that specific rank. A player CAN increase the rank of a facility at any
  location by N by announcement by destroying N crystals in eir possession.

  Crystals are a currency, with the Treasuror as their recordkeepor.
  They may be owned by Agora, persons, and contracts. The following units
  are defined:

  - Bronze Crystal, 1 crystal
  - Silver Crystal, 2 crystals
  - Gold Crystal, 4 crystals
  - Platinum Crystal, 8 crystals

Amend the rule defining welcome packages by adding as a new item, appropriately
numbered, at the end of the list "1 Bronze Crystal".

defined, and are tracked by the Treasuror." to read "The following currencies,
known collectively as economic currencies, are defined, and are tracked by the

  to create 5 economic currencies of specified, possibly varying type.

[I expect the above to be expanded in future.]
