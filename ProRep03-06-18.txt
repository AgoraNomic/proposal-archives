In Rule 105 “Rule Changes,” replace

  "If the reenacting proposal provides new text for the rule, the rule
  must have materially the same purpose as did the repealed version;
  otherwise, the attempt to reenact the rule is null and void.”

with

  “If the reenacting proposal provides new text for the rule, the
  rule SHOULD have materially the same purpose as did the repealed version."

The Rulekeepor MAY list historical annotations for changes made by the
following portion of this proposal (until the text “END CLEANUP”) however e
wishes, including incorrectly or not at all.

If rule 2599 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following
text; if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it
to have the following text: {

 If a player has not received a Welcome Package since e most
  recently registered, any player CAN cause em to receive one by
  announcement.

  When a player receives a Welcome Package, Agora creates the
  following assets in eir possession:

  1. 10 coins
  2. 5 lumber
  3. 5 stones
  4. 10 apples
  5. 3 papers
}

If no rule titled “Paydays” exists, create it at power 2 with the following
text; if it exists but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Whenever a Payday occurs, the following events happen in order:

  1. The following assets are created in the possession of each
     player:
     A. 10 coins
     B. 5 apples
     C. 2 papers

  2. For each office, if a single player held that office for 16 or
     more days in the previous month and e was not issued any Cards
     other than Green for eir conduct in that office during that
     time, the following assets are created in the possession of
     that player:
     A. 5 coins
     B. 1 corn

  The occurrence of Paydays is secured.  At the beginning of each
  month, a Payday occurs.
}

If Rule 1993 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Arcadia is a land entirely defined by the Arcadian Map (the Map).
  The Map is the term for the set of all Land Units.

  The Map divides Arcadia into a finite, discrete number of Units of
  Land, or simply Land. Each Unit of Land is an indestructible asset
  specified by an ordered pair of integers known as its Latitude and
  Longitude.

  Every unique ordered pair of integers within the limits defined in
  the Rules for Latitude and Longitude signifies an existent Unit of
  Land. No other Units of Land exist. Units of Land CAN only be
  created or destroyed by changing the limits of Latitude and
  Longitude defined in the Rules.

  All values for Latitude and Longitude MUST lie between -6 and +6,
  inclusive.

  The Total Land Area of Arcadia is the number of existent Units of
  Land defined by permissible Latitude and Longitude pairs.
}

If Rule 1994 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Any existent Land for which ownership has not been explicitly
  changed belongs to Agora.

  Land belonging to Agora is called Public Land. Land belonging to
  a contract is called Communal Land. Land belonging to any other
  entity is called Private Land. Together, Communal Land and Private
  Land are called Proprietary Land.
}

If Rule 1995 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Each Unit of Land has a Land Type switch, tracked by the
  Cartographor, whose values are "Black", "White", and "Aether" (the
  default). Changes to Land Type switches are secured. To "change
  the type" of, or to "transform" a Unit of Land is to flip its Type
  switch. A “Unit of X” is a Unit of Land whose Land Type switch has
  the value X.

  When existent Land has not had its Type changed as explicitly
  permitted by the Rules, or has a Type that is not currently
  defined by the Rules, it is considered to have the Land Type of
  Aether. Rules to the contrary nonwithstanding, Units of Aether
  CANNOT be transferred from Agora, or owned by any entity other
  than Agora.

  If Proprietary Land becomes Aether, the Cartographor SHALL
  transfer it to Agora in a timely fashion, destroy any facilities
  on the Land Unit, and set all other switches to their default
  values.

  Type is a singleton switch with the values of Black and White,
  defaulting to Black. When an act specifies that an alternating
  land type is to be used, the current value of the Alternating Land
  Type switch is used, and the switch is set to the next value of
  the switch.
}

If Rule 1996 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  The Cartographor is an office; its holder is recordkeepor for the
  Land of Arcadia.

  The Cartographor's Weekly Report shall include:

  1. the ownership and land type of all existing land;
  2. all changes in the ownership and land type of existing land
     since the most recent report;
  3. the location for the previous week and the current week of each
     entity with a defined location;
  4. the next alternating land type;
  5. all facilities and their parent land units; and
  6. a list of all preserved land units.
}

If Rule 1996 is not titled “The Cartographor”, retitle it “The Cartographor”.

If Rule 1998 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Two Units of Land are Adjacent if they have the same Latitude, and
  their Longitudes differ by exactly one; or they have the same
  Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by exactly one.

  Land Unit A is said to be connected to Land Unit B if it is
  possible to reach B by moving only to adjacent Land Units of the
  same color, starting from A.
}

If Rule 1999 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Location is a player switch, tracked by the Cartographer, whose
  values are ordered pairs of integers where the first value is a
  valid Latitude, and the second is a valid Longitude. The default
  Location is (0, 0).

  To "move" a player is to flip that player’s Location switch to the
  Latitude and Longitude of the destination.

  No other Entity can have a location unless it is defined in a rule
  other than this one. Changes to the Location of an Entity are
  secured. If an Entity is specified by this Rule as having a
  defined Location, but its Location has not been explicitly set or
  changed, its Location is set to (0, 0).
}

If Rule 2003 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Players CAN destroy:

  1. 1 apple to move from one Land Unit to an adjacent Unit if their
     Land Types are the same and the destination is not Aether;

  2. 2 apples to move from one Land Unit to an adjacent Unit if
     their Land Types differ and the destination is not Aether;

  3. 2 apples to set Land Type of a Land Unit which e owns to any
     Land Type other than Aether, whether or not e is located at
     that Land Unit.

  4. 3 apples to set the Land Type of a Land Unit that is adjacent
     to the Entity's current location, is of type Aether, and is
     owned by Agora, to an alternating Land Type.

  5. 4 apples to set the Land Type of a Land Unit that is adjacent
     to the Entity's current location, is of type Aether, and is
     owned by Agora, to a Land Type of eir choice.

  6. 6 apples to set the Land Type of a Land Unit that is of type
     Aether, and is owned by Agora, to an alternating Land Type.

  Players CAN, while performing the above actions, substitute 3
  apples for 1 corn.
}

If rule 2004 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Every Agoran Week, if the number of units of Private Land is less
  than one half the total number of units of Land, an auction SHALL
  be initiated. For this auction, the announcer is the Cartographor,
  the auctioneer is the Cartographor, the lots are chosen as such:

  1. if there exist at least 5 Units of non-Aether Land in the
     possession of Agora with the preservation switch set to False:
     any 5 such Units of Land, to be chosen by the Cartographor,
     each Land Unit in a separate lot;

  2. if there exist fewer than 5 Units of non-Aether Land in the
     possession of Agora: all such Units, each land unit in a
     separate lot;

  and the minimum bid is 1 coin.
}

If Rule 2022 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  During the second Eastman week of each Agoran Month, the
  Cartographor SHALL perform the following actions in sequence, and
  report these changes:

  1. Every Land Unit, with a preservation switch of False
     that is not directly connected to a unit of Aether, or is not
     connected by its own type to a unit of Aether, shall be
     transformed to Aether.

  2. Any entities whose locations are on land units so transformed
     shall have their locations set to (0, 0).

  3. If any land unit so transformed is not property of Agora, it
     becomes property of Agora.
}

If Rule 2022 is not titled “Land Transfiguration”, retitle it
“Land Transfiguration”.

  be destroyed by the owner by announcement. Facilities on communal land can be
  destroyed by the owning contract by announcement. Facilities on public land
