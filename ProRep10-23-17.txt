  Citizenship is a person switch with values Unregistered

  citizenship are secured.  A registered person is a Player.

  A person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or prevented by the
  rules) register by publishing a message that indicates
  reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e intends
  to become a player at that time.  A person, by registering,
  agrees to abide by the Rules.  The Rules CANNOT otherwise bind a
  person to abide by any agreement without that person's willful
  consent.

  A player CAN deregister (cease being a player) by announcement.
  If e does so, e CANNOT register by announcement for 30 days.

  A doubt is an explicit public challenge via one of the following
  methods, identifying a document and explaining the scope and
  nature of a perceived error in it:

     publish that document) or SHOULD (otherwise) do one of the
     following in a timely fashion:

Title: High Power Cleanup
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Alexis
Co-authors: G., Publius Scribonius Scholasticus


Text in square brackets is not a substantive part of this proposal and is
ignored when it takes effect.

Amend Rule 105, bullet 2 to read "When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a rule,
its power is set to 0, and the Rulekeepor need no longer maintain a record
of it."

[There is a ruling that repealed rules have their power set to 0, but I'm
not sure I fully agree with that conclusion; this makes it explicit which
can't hurt anyway.]

Amend Rule 106 by appending "Except insofar as the actions performed by a
proposal happen one after another, rather than simultaneously, a proposal's
effect is instantaneous. A proposal can neither delay nor extend its own
effect. Once a propsal finishes taking effect, its power is set to 0."

[Per discussion, do the same for proposals. While here, make it clear that
proposals are instantaneous. Please nitpick this, I'm pretty sure it's safe
but this is a very dangerous rule to get wrong.]

Set the power of all entities other than Rules, Regulations, and this
Proposal to 0. If rule 2493 was repealed, or the word "instrument" does not
appear in its text, also set the power of all Regulations to 0.

[This is a general cleanup that catches repealed rules and other entities.]

Amend Rule 105, bullet 3 by appending "Unless specified otherwise by the
re-enacting instrument, a re-enacted rule has power equal to the power it
had at the time of its repeal (or power 1, if power was not defined at the
time of that rule's repeal). If the re-enacting instrument is incapable of
setting the re-enacted rule's power to that value, then the re-enactment is
null and void."

[Re-enactment currently doesn't have a specified power; this causes it to
work roughly the way you would expect it to.]

Amend Rule 1023 by appending "The same applies, mutatis mutandis, to for
determining whether two points in time are within N months of each other,
for N greater than or equal to 2." as a new paragraph in the fourth bullet
in the first list.

[This makes the logical extension to "within 6 months", which is used,
explicit.]

Create the following Power-2 Rule "Zombies":

  Master is a secured player switch with possible values of any
  player, and Agora.  Every player's default master is emself;
  rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a player CAN always flip
  eir own master to emself by announcement.

  A player whose master is not emself is a Zombie. A zombie's
  master, if another player, is allowed to act on behalf of the
  zombie (i.e. as the zombie's agent) to perform LEGAL actions.

  If a player has not made a public announcement in the past
  60 days, then any player CAN flip that player's master to
  Agora by announcement.

  Each zombie whose master is another player has an untracked
  switch indicating whether the zombie Owes a Scare to Agora,
  with values FALSE (default) and TRUE. All such switches are
  flipped to TRUE at the beginning of each month.  A zombie's
  master CAN flip that zombie's switch to FALSE by causing the
  zombie to perform a scary public action for the announced
  purpose of satisfying this scare debt.  If that switch for a
  given zombie is TRUE at the end of a month, then within the
  next seven days any player can flip that zombie's master to
  Agora by announcement.

  This switch is of course the zombie's Boo Lien switch.

Re-enact Rule 1885 (power-1) with a title "Zombie Auctions" and the
following text:

  Whenever a zombie has Agora for a master and an auction for it
  is not underway or been won in the last seven days, then the
  Registrar CAN and SHALL, in a timely fashion, put the specified
  zombie up for auction by announcement. Each auction ends seven
  days after it begins.

  During an auction, any player who is not a zombie CAN bid a
  number of Shinies for the specified zombie by announcement.

  The winner of the auction, if any, is the player who bids the
  highest number of shinies, with ties broken in favor of the
  earlier bidder.  The winner CAN and SHALL, in a timely fashion,
  flip the zombie's master to the winner by announcement, if e
  pays Agora the amount of the bid for the explicit and sole
  purpose of fulfilling this requirement. If there are no bids,
  the auction has no winner.

  If a zombie being auctioned ceases to have Agora as a master at
  any time between the initiation of the auction and the winner
  becoming the zombie's master (or failing to do so in a timely
  fashion after the auction), then the auction has no winner, and
  any obligations to pay for the zombie are voided.

Title: A Most Ingenious Paradox

  that CFJ, then that case's initiator CAN, by announcement, win the
  game.

  prevent the paradox from arising again.

  was initiated (if its truth value changed at that time, then its
  initial truth value is used):

  initiated, not taking into account any events since that time:

[This is to prevent changing facts not related to truth or falsity, e.g.
availability of information, from affecting outcomes.]

  appropriate if PARADOXICAL is appropriate.

and by appending to the end:

  * PARADOXICAL, appropriate if the statement is logically
    undecidable as a result of a paradox or or other irresovable
    logical situation. PARADOXICAL is not appropriate if IRRELEVANT
    is appropriate, nor is it appropriate if the undecidability
    arises from the case itself.
