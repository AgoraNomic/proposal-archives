Amend Rule 591 (Delivering Judgements) by replacing:
      When a CFJ is open and assigned to a judge, that judge CAN
      assign a valid judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so
      in a timely fashion after this becomes possible.  If e does not,
      the Arbitor CAN remove em from being the judge of that case by
      announcement.

      in a timely fashion after this becomes possible.  If e does not,

      announcement, and SHALL do so in a timely fashion after the
      time limit expires, unless the judge assigns a valid judgement
      in the mean time.

[Allows deputisation to remove late judges by adding a SHALL]


Amend Rule 991 (Calls for Judgement) by appending the following
paragraph:

      The Arbitor's weekly report includes a summary of recent
      judicial case activity, including open and recently-judged
      cases, recent judicial assignments, and a list of players
      interested in judging.

[Easiest way to fix the Arbitor's pay, but not just a make-work
report - in the past, regular Arbitor reports have been useful to
keep players informed about the state of judgements and the courts,
which promotes more ongoing clarity in the game state].

Amend rule 2450 ("Pledges") to read, in full:

    {
        Pledges are an indestructible fixed asset. Ownership of pledges
        is restricted to persons. The Referee is the recordkeepor of
        pledges. Creating, destroying, modifying, and transferring
        pledges are secured.

        To "pledge" something is to create a pledge with those terms. A
        person CAN pledge by announcement.

        To "retract" (syn "withdraw") a pledge is to destroy it. A
        person CAN retract a pledge they own without objection.

        To "call in" a pledge" is to destroy it. A player can call in
        any pledge with Agoran Consent, if e announces a reason the
        Terms of the pledge should be considered broken. Support for an
        intent to call in a pledge is INEFFECTIVE unless the supporting
        player explicitly confirms the reasons that the pledge should
        be considered broken.

        It is ILLEGAL to own a pledge when it is called in.

        Jan 20th 2009 that has since led to me being a fugitive. For
        the explanation to be valid for this pledge, it should be fully
        self contained, I should not have to go look up past rules in
        order to understand the explanation (So please, include all
        source info in the explanation).
    }

             controversy:

             b.  At most once per day, and and most 5 times per week, I'll

                 requested by the submitter).

             c.  By request, the submitter may remain anonymous.

             d.  Absolutely free of charge, as able, I'll research and
                 add gratuitous arguments in favor of the submitter's
                 position, and I'll not argue against the submitter's
                 position except in private with the submitter.
