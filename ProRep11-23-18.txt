Title: Proposals aren't worth *that* much
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Trigon

Amend rule 2496 by replacing the text "the total strength of all valid
ballots", wherever it appears, to "the number of valid ballots".

Title: The judge switch
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: G.
Co-authors:


Amend R991 (Calls for Judgement) by replacing the paragraph beginning
"When a CFJ has no judge assigned" with the following text:

  Judge is an untracked CFJ switch with possible values of any
  person or "unassigned" (default).  To "assign" a CFJ to a person
  is to flip that CFJ's judge to that person.  To "remove" or
  "recuse" a person from a being the judge of a CFJ is to flip that
  CFJ's judge from that person to unassigned.

  When a CFJ's judge is unassigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
  eligible player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so
  in a timely fashion. The players eligible to be assigned as judge
  are all active players except the initiator and the person barred
  (if any). The Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all
  interested players have reasonably equal opportunities to judge.
  If a CFJ has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to judge
  that CFJ CAN assign it to emself Without 3 Objections.


[I think all instances of judge assignment/removal work with the
above definitions, without further modification].

For every CFJ that was assigned to a judge immediately before this
proposal took effect, that CFJ's judge switch is flipped to that
judge.

[Note:  all old cases - however old - are still considered to have
their last-assigned judge (judges are not "removed" when a case is
closed).  This is true both before and after this proposal].

Author: twg

Amend Rule 2555 to replace:

  “If a player has neither gained blots nor expunged any blots from emself
  in the current Agoran week, e CAN expunge 1 blot from emself by
  announcement.”

With:

  “At the end of each Agoran week, 1 blot is automatically expunged from each
  impure player who that week had not gained any blots.”

Title: I hate myself
Adoption index: 3.0

Rules or Instruments to the contrary notwithstanding, this proposal
shall act as though its text is the text submitted to a public forum and
clearly marked "Memes submission" by the last person to vote FOR it.

Title: Uncorrecting Rewards
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: twg, Trigon

[
  This is A.I. 3.0 because I don't know what Rule 2496's power is.
  Proposal 8127 "reenacted" it, meaning it acquires the power it had
  when it was originally repealed, but I wasn't around when that
  happened and it's not in the SLR yet.
]

Amend rule 2496 by replacing all instances of the text "create in eir
possession" with the word "earn".

Title: Access to contracts' assets
Adoption index: 2.5
Author: twg
Co-authors:

[ Been floating around in my mind since G. and D. Margaux pulled off
  the "First Bank of Agora" scam, which frankly deserved to work
  first time. This proposal allows contract parties to manipulate the
  contract's assets as permitted by the contract, and also tidies up
  the verbiage a little bit. ]

Amend Rule 1742, "Contracts", by replacing the last paragraph with
the following:

  A party to a contract CAN perform any of the following actions
  as permitted by the contract's text:

  * Act on behalf of another party to the contract.

  * Destroy destructible assets in the contract's possession.

  * Transfer liquid assets in the contract's possession.
