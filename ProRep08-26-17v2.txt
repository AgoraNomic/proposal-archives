Title: Agoraculture
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: o
Co-authors: babelian


Enact a new rule, with power 1.0, titled "Farm Rate", with the following text:

  The Farm Rate is a natural singleton switch, tracked by the
  Agronomist.

Set the Farm Rate to 20.

Enact a new rule, with power 2.0, titled "Agoraculture", with the following
text:

  Each Estate has a Farm switch, tracked by the Agronomist, with
  values "farmed" and "unfarmed", defaulting to "unfarmed". Changes
  to Farm switches are secured. An Estate whose Farm switch is
  "farmed" is a Farm, and its owner is the Farmer of that Estate.

  In the first week of an Agoran month, the owner of an unfarmed
  Estate MAY flip its Farm switch to "farmed" by announcement, if e
  pays Agora a number of shinies equal to the Farm Rate.

  In the first week of an Agoran month, the owner of a Farm MAY till
  the farm by announcement, if e pays Agora a number of shinies equal
  to the Farm Rate. If the Farmer of an Estate does not till it
  within the first week of an Agoran month, the Agronomist CAN flip
  its Farm switch to "unfarmed" by announcement, and SHALL do so in a
  timely fashion.

  When an Estate is transferred to Agora or to an Organization, its
  Farm switch is set to "unfarmed" immediately afterwards.

Enact a new rule, with power 2.0, titled "Comestibles", with the following text:

  A Comestible is a type of liquid asset, which can be owned by
  players. Creating Comestibles is secured. The recordkeepor of
  Comestibles is the Agronomist.

  The Farmer of an Estate may offer Comestibles by announcement,
  naming a number of Comestibles offered and a price per Comestible
  in Shinies. A player CANNOT offer more Comestibles in a month than
  10 times the number of Farms e owns. The Farmer is ENCOURAGED to
  name the kind of Comestibles on offer after a plant, vegetable,
  grain, livestock, or other farm good.

  A player other than the offering Farmer may accept a Comestibles
  offer by announcement to create that number of Comestibles in eir
  possession, if e pays the offering Farmer the price per Comestible
  named in the offer times the number of Comestbiles offered. The
  Value of a Comestible created this way is equal to the price per
  Comestible offered by the Farmer.

  An offer expires at the end of the Agoran month in which it is
  made. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an offer CANNOT be
  accepted if it has expired.

  During an Agoran Decision, a player can increase their voting
  strength on that decision by destroying (syn. "eating",
  "consuming") Comestibles. Eir voting strength is increased by
  one-tenth the total Value of the Comestibles destroyed this way,
  rounded down, to a maximum of 5.

  A Comestible is an Expired Comestible if it was created by
  accepting an offer announced more than three Agoran months ago. An
  Expired Comestible CANNOT be consumed to increase voting strength,
  and MAY be destroyed by any player, by announcement. The Agronomist
  SHALL destroy all Expired Comestibles at the start of each Agoran
  month.

Enact a new rule, with power 2.0, titled “The Agronomist”, with the following
text:

  The Agronomist is an office.

  The Agronomist's weekly report includes:

  * A list of Farms and their owners.

  * A list of Comestibles offers that have not been accepted and have
    not expired.

Make babelian the Agronomist.
