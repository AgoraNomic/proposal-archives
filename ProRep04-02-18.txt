and by appending the following sentence to its text:
  The person who initiates a tournament is its Gamemaster.


Create the following Rule, Free Tournaments:

  A player who is not the gamemaster of an existing tournament CAN
  initiate a sanctioned tournament with a specified set of regulations
  with 2 Agoran Consent. A tournament created using this method is
  called a Free Tournament. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, only
  players CAN win the game via a free tournament.

  A free tournament CAN be concluded with no winner without 3 objections.
  Tournaments SHOULD only be concluded in this manner if it is clear that
