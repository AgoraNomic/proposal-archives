It has come to the attention of the Promotorial Proposal Office that certain
proposals were incorrectly numbered. Twice. I sincerely apologize for this grave
lapse.

All proposals numbered 33## or 35## and distributed within the last week
are hereby renumbered 83##, where the final two digits remain the same. Here is
a revised index of proposals up for vote (each of the decisions on whether to
adopt them has a quorum of 6). All players are hereby advised to treat these
numbers as canonical from the present moment forward, and to vote in reply
to this index as if it were an original distribution.

Co-authors: Alexis, twg


For each of Proposals 8287-8307, if the proposal took effect more than
once, then any changes to rule text caused by the second and later
times the proposal took effect are considered "extra" for the purposes
of this proposal.

Reverse all such "extra" changes, in the reverse of the order in which
they occurred.

[Comment: See https://mailman.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-discussion/2020-February/056587.html
for context. I think the changes this undoes are relatively benign,
but it's nice to have certainty about the state of the ruleset.]

Title: Inflation Vote
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Falsifian
Co-authors:


[Comments:

Are we just going to let a steady stream of sufficiently dedicated
players claim their standard victories? I say we raise the bar a
little.

There's been some talk of a larger re-working of the economy. In the
meantime, this proposal calls for players to vote on a new number to
replace the 1,000 coin victory fee. The median vote wins, favouring the
higher vote if there are two middle votes.

]

For the purpose of this proposal:

* An Inflation Ballot is a body of text published during the voting
  period of this proposal that clearly, directly and without
  obfuscation specifies a single non-negative integer and that it is an
  Inflation Ballot.

* Each player's Inflation Vote is the integer specified in the last
  Inflation Ballot they published, or "none" if they never published
  one.

* P is the number of players with Inflation Votes other than "none".

* Median is the (unique) integer such that that at least P/2 Inflation
  Votes are integers greater than or equal to Median, and at least
  (P/2+0.5) Inflation votes are integers less than or equal to Median.

Amend Rule 2483 (Economics) by replacing "1,000" with Median, written
in decimal with commas separating groups of three digits, as in
"12,345,678".

  If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate,
  then any player CAN by announcement declare em the winner of the
  election, thereby causing em to win the election. If at any point
  an uncontested election has no candidates, then any player CAN
  declare the election ended with no winner by announcement.

this text:

  In each of these cases, the ADoP SHALL so announce in a timely
  fashion, unless someone else has already done so.

[I think the recent resolutions of Treasuror and Tailor, while still
effective resolutions, didn't count as temporary deputisation because
the ADoP wasn't required to do them.]
