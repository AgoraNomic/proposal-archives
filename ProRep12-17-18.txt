Title: Access to contracts' assets v2
Adoption index: 2.5
Author: twg
Co-authors: G.


[ Been floating around in my mind since G. and D. Margaux pulled off
  the "First Bank of Agora" scam, which frankly deserved to work
  first time. This proposal allows contract parties to manipulate the
  contract's assets as permitted by the contract, and also tidies up
  the verbiage a little bit. ]

[ v2 brings the following changes:
  * Added "by announcement" to the latter two bullet points
    (preventing assets from being destroyed/transferred by private
    messages!).
  * Rephrased to use the verbs defined in Rule 2577, "Asset
    Actions". ]

Amend Rule 1742, "Contracts", by replacing the last paragraph with
the following:

  A party to a contract CAN perform any of the following actions
  as permitted by the contract's text:

  * Act on behalf of another party to the contract.

  * By announcement, revoke destructible assets from the contract.

  * By announcement, take liquid assets from the contract.

            Ørjan, Trigon


Enact a new rule "Sectors" (Power=1.0) with the following text:

  Sectors are entities; each Sector has an ID number, which is (the
  number of existent sectors that were created before it + 1).

  Creating, destroying or altering Sectors is secured.

  If no Spaceship is in a particular Sector, then that Sector is
  "empty"; otherwise it is "occupied".

  Two Sectors are "adjacent" if their IDs differ by exactly 1.


Enact a new rule "Galaxy Maintenance" (Power=1.0) with the following
text:

  Ideal Sector Count is the number of Spaceships plus two.

  If there are ever fewer Sectors than the Ideal Sector Count, then
  the Astronomor CAN by announcement and SHALL in a timely fashion
  create a new Sector.

  If there are ever more Sectors than the Ideal Sector Count, then
  the Astronomor CAN by announcement and SHALL in a timely fashion
  destroy an empty Sector.

  Violation of this rule is the Class-3 Crime of Galaxy Neglect.

  Enact a new rule "The Astronomor" (Power=1.0) with the following text:

    The Astronomor is an office. The Astronomor's weekly report
    includes, in addition to any information required by other rules, a
    list of all Sectors and their ID numbers.

Enact a new rule "Spaceships" (Power=1.0) with the following text:

  Spaceships are a class of fixed asset, tracked by the Astronomor,
  with ownership restricted to players. The following are Spaceship
  switches, tracked by the Astronomor:

  * Location (possible values any Sector, defaulting to the Sector
    with the lowest ID number);

  * Armour (an integer switch limited to values from 0 to 10
    inclusive).

  A Spaceship is "in" its Location. For a Spaceship to "move" to a
  Sector is for its Location to be flipped to that Sector. When a
  player registers, a Spaceship is created in eir possession. When a
  Spaceship is created, it immediately moves to the lowest-numbered
  empty Sector, if any.

  A Spaceship with an Armour of 0 is "Defeated". A Spaceship is
  "Pilotable" if it is neither Defeated nor engaging in a Space
  Battle.

  Any player CAN, by announcement, spend a coin to increase the
  Armour of a Pilotable Spaceship e owns by 1. This is called
  "Repairing" the Spaceship.

Enact a new rule "Spaceship Energy" (Power=1.0) with the following
text:

  Energy is a fixed currency, tracked by the Astronomor, with
  ownership restricted to Spaceships. If a Spaceship's Energy
  balance exceeds 20, any excess Energy it possesses is destroyed.

  When a Spaceship is created, 20 Energy is created in its possession.

  At the start of each Agoran day, each Pilotable Spaceship gains 2
  Energy. Any player also CAN, by announcement, pay 2 coins to grant
  a Pilotable Spaceship e owns 1 Energy.

  Any player CAN, by announcement, cause a Pilotable Spaceship e
  owns to pay 1 Energy to move to a Sector adjacent to its Location.

Enact a new rule "Space Battles" (Power=1.0) with the following text:

  Two players are "allied" if they agree to be allied or if one is
  the master of the other; otherwise they are "opponents". For the
  purposes of this rule, agreement includes both consent and
  agreement specified by contract.

  A player who owns a Pilotable Spaceship in the same Sector as one of
  eir opponents' Pilotable Spaceships CAN, by announcement, initiate a
  Space Battle between the two Spaceships. These two players are the
  "combatants" of the Space Battle, and the two Spaceships are then
  "engaging" in the Space Battle until it is resolved.

  A Space Battle CANNOT be initiated if either of the two involved
  Spaceships has been engaging in a Space Battle within the last 24
  hours.

  The resolver for a Space Battle is the player highest in the
  following list at the time of the Space Battle's initiation who is
  not a combatant in the Space Battle:

  1) the Astronomor;
  2) the Arbitor;
  3) the Prime Minister;
  4) the non-combatant who has least recently registered.

  For the initiation of a Space Battle to be EFFECTIVE, the initiator
  must correctly specify the resolver.

  In a timely fashion after a Space Battle is initiated, the
  combatants SHALL each once communicate to the resolver the amount
  of Energy they wish to spend in the battle, via any method that
  cannot be understood by the other combatant until e has also
  fulfilled this obligation. For example:

  * by publishing a salted cryptographic hash, and revealing its text
    after the other combatant has also communicated the Energy e will
    spend;
  * by sending the amount to the resolver in a private message;
  * by publishing the amount, if the other combatant has already
    communicated the Energy e will spend.

  Failing to do so is the Class-2 Crime of Being a Bad Space Captain.

  For the resolver to reveal the Energy a combatant is spending
  before both combatants have made their decisions is the Class-5
  Crime of Violating General Relativity.

  After both combatants have communicated the Energy they will spend,
  or if the time limit to do so has expired, the resolver CAN, and
  SHALL in a timely fashion, resolve the Space Battle by announcing
  the changes in each Spaceship's Energy balance and Armour
  (described below), and the Winner (if any) of the Space Battle.

  When a Space Battle is resolved:

  1) N Energy is revoked from each Spaceship, where N is the lesser of
     the Spaceship's Energy balance and the amount of Energy decided
     on by the Spaceship's owner, or 0 if the Spaceship's owner
     failed to do so;
  2) each Spaceship's Armour is decreased by X, where X is the lesser
     of the Spaceship's Armour and the amount of Energy revoked from
     the other Spaceship;
  3) the Winner of the Space Battle is the combatant, if any, whose
     Spaceship's Armour was reduced by a smaller amount than the other
     Spaceship's.

Enact a new rule "Fame" (Power=1.0) with the following text:

  Fame is an integer player switch tracked by the Astronomor, limited
  to values between -10 and 10 inclusive. Players with positive Fame
  are "Famous", and those with negative Fame are "Infamous".

  If a player is the Winner in a Space Battle against an Infamous
  player, eir Fame is increased by 1. Likewise, if a player is the
  Winner in a Space Battle against a Famous player or one with a Fame
  of 0, eir Fame is decreased by 1.

  Any player whose Fame is either 10 or -10 CAN win the game With 2
  Days Notice.

Perform the following action a number of times equal to (the number of
registered players + 2): Create a Sector.



Perform the following action for each player, iterating over them in
order of the days of the year (1 January to 31 December) on which they
most recently registered, breaking ties in order of the times at which
they most recently registered: Create a Spaceship in the possession of
that player.

Amend Rule 2496, "Rewards", by replacing its text with the following:

  A player CAN earn the set of assets associated with a reward
  condition exactly once in a timely fashion each time e fulfills it
  by stating how many assets e earns as a result of this action.

  Below is a list of reward conditions and their associated assets.

  * Being the author of an adopted proposal: a number of coins equal
    to ((the total number of valid ballots cast FOR the decision -
    the total number of valid ballots cast AGAINST) times the
    adoption index of the result) rounded up.

  * Judging a CFJ that e was assigned to without violating a time
    limit to do so: 5 coins.

  * Publishing a duty-fulfilling report: 5 coins. For each office,
    this reward can only be claimed for the first weekly report
    published in a week and the first monthly report published in a
    month.

  * Having a Thesis pass peer-review and be granted a Degree based
    on its merit: 20 coins

Re-enact Rule 2533, "Political Parties" (Power=2.0), with the
following text:

  There are 5 Parties, in order:

  - Platonic Isolationists
  - New Punchbowl Reformers
  - Costume Conservatives
  - Substance Use Liberals
  - Official Raving Monster Looney Party

  Politicians are entities; each Politician has a name and an
  associated Party. Politicians exist only as specified by the
  rules. Creating, altering, or destroying Politicians is secured.

  If there are ever fewer than 20 Politicians, then the Clork CAN by
  announcement and SHALL in a timely fashion create a new Politician,
  specifying eir Party and name. The Party must be selected at random
  from:

  - The set of Parties with the lowest number of Politicians if any
    Party has fewer than 3;
  - Otherwise, the set of Parties with fewer than 5 Politicians.

Re-enact Rule 2534, "Clork" (Power=2.0), with the following text:

  The Clork is an office. The Clork's weekly report includes:
  - a list of all Politicans with their names and Parties.
  - the assignment of Policies to Parties.

Re-enact Rule 2535, "Echelon Forms" (Power=2.0), with the following
text:

  Posts are entities. Holder is a Post switch, tracked by the Clork,
  with possible values all Politicians and none (default). No
  Politician can hold more than one Post at a time. Each Post is in
  an Echelon, which has an associated Rank. The Echelons, and their
  Posts and Ranks, are as follows:

  Chamber of Power (Rank 5):
  - Host
  Upper Echelon (Rank 3):
  - Planner
  - Enforcer
  - Organizer
  - Creep
  Row Echelon (Rank 1):
  - Schmoozer
  - Decorator
  - Loner
  - Drunk
  - Mystery
  - Wild One
  - Hat Rack

  Each Politician who holds a Post is in the Echelon of that post;
  other Politicians are in the Row-Reduced Echelon, which has Rank
  0. Likewise, the Rank of a Post or Politician is the Rank of their
  Echelon.

  If a rule provides that a Post can take an action, then the
  Advisor of the holder of that Post CAN take that action. If there
  is no such player, and the Post is required to take that action,
  then the Clork CAN do it prior to any deadline for its
  performance. After a deadline for a Post to perform an action, any
  player CAN take it.

Re-enact Rule 2536, "Taken Under Advisement" (Power=2.0), with the
following text:

  Advisor is a Politician switch, tracked by the Clork, with
  possible values all players and none (default). For each
  Politician, Influence over <Politician> is a natural player
  switch, tracked by the Clork.

  A player CAN, by announcement, spend Favours in a Politician's
  Party to gain Influence over that Politician, depending on the
  Politician's Echelon:
  - Chamber of Power: 3 Favours for 2 Influence
  - Upper Echelon: 1 Favour for 1 Influence
  - Row Echelon: 2 Favours for 3 Influence
  - Row-Reduced Echelon: 1 Favour for 2 Influence

  If a player has more Influence over a given Politician than any
  other player, e can Advise that Politican by announcement. When e
  does so, if no other player Advises the same Politician later in
  the same Agoran week, then at the start of the next Agoran week,
  that player becomes that Politician's Advisor.

Re-enact Rule 2537, "Balloons" (Power=2.0), with the following text:

  Balloons are a fixed currency, tracked by the Clork, with
  ownership restricted to players. Creation or destruction of
  balloons is secured.

  At the start of each Agoran week, after Advisors are flipped:
  - For each player, if e owns more Balloons than e was awarded by
    this procedure at the start of the previous week, any excess
    Balloons are destroyed.
  - Each player is awarded Balloons equal to the sum of the Ranks of
    the Politicians for which e is Advisor.
  - The Decorator's Advisor, if any is awarded one additional
    Balloon.

  A player CAN, by announcement, spend a Balloon e owns to increase
  eir voting strength on a specified Agoran Decision, other than one
  with an adoption index of 3 or higher, by 1.

  A player CAN, by announcement, spend Balloons equal to the sum of
  the Ranks of all Posts in order to win the game. Upon doing so,
  all eir Influence switches are set to 0.

Re-enact Rule 2538, "Party Favours" (Power=2.0), with the following
text:

  For each Party, there is a currency called Favours in that Party.
  Ownership of Favours is tracked by the Clork. Ownership of Favours
  is restricted to players.

  A player CAN, by announcement, spend 3 Favours in a single Party
  to award another player 2 Favours in that Party.

  A player CAN, by announcement, spend 3 Favours in a single Party
  to gain a Favour in another specified Party.

Re-enact Rule 2539, "Retirement" (Power=2.0), with the following
text:

  Stress Level is a natural Politician switch, tracked by the Clork.
  At the start of each Agoran week, each Politician's Stress Level
  is increased by eir Rank. If, after this procedure, a Politician's
  Stress Level is 20 or greater, the Politician announces retirement
  and is destroyed at the beginning of the following Agoran week.
  The Clork SHALL announce this fact in a timely fashion.

Re-enact Rule 2540, "Political Elections" (Power=2.0), with the
following text:

  For each Post, Vote for <Post> is a secured Politician switch
  tracked by the Clork, with possible values all Politicians and
  undecided (default).

  The voting strength of a Politician for a Post is defined as
  follows:
  - For an election for Host, Politicians have strength equal to
    their Rank.
  - For an election for an Upper Echelon Post, the Host has strength
    4, and Upper Echelon Politicians have strength 2.
  - For an election for a Row Echelon Post, the Host has strength 3,
    Upper Echelon Politicians have strength 2, and Row Echelon
    politicians have strength 1.
  - The Organizer has voting strength 1 greater than e would have
    based on the above.

  The eligible Politicians in an election for a Post are all
  Politicians in the highest non-empty Echelon below that of the
  Post up for election. The number of votes cast for an eligible
  Politician in an election is the sum of voting strengths for that
  Post of all Politicians whose Vote for that Post is the eligible
  Politician; the number of votes cast for a Politician that is not
  eligible is 0.

  An election for a Post is resolvable if that Post is vacant, there
  is a single Politician with the most votes in that election, and
  either at least four days have passed since either the vacancy or
  since its previous occupant Announced Retirement, whichever was
  first, or if the leader has more votes than the Policitian with
  the second-most, plus the total voting strength of all undecided
  Politicians in that election. When an election for a Post is
  resolvable, any player CAN, by announcement, end the election and
  install the winning Politician (which must be specified or else
  the announcement is INEFFECTIVE) into the Post.

  If a Post is vacant and either has been so for seven days or more
  than eleven days have passed since its previous holder Announced
  Retirement, then the Host CAN and SHALL, in a timely fashion, by
  announcement end the election and install one of the Politicians
  with the most votes into the Post.

  When an election for a Post ends, all Vote switches for that Post
  are set to undecided.

Enact a new rule "Party Policy" (Power=2.0) with the following text:

  There are 5 Policies, in order:

  - Justice: interested in seeing justice served
  - Efficiency: interested in seeing official duties performed
  - Legislation: interested in seeing proposals passed
  - Participation: interested in seeing votes cast
  - Economy: interested in economic activity

  At any time, each Policy is held by exactly one Party. The
  assignments must be in cyclic order of their definitions, wrapping
  from bottom to top. For example, if the Platonic Isolationists
  hold Participation as their Policy, then the New Punchbowl Reformers
  hold Economy, the Costume Conservatives hold Justice, and so on.

  At the start of each Agoran month, the Planner CAN and SHALL, in a
  timely fashion, by announcement, select a new assignment of
  Policies to Parties (specifying the Policy of one Party is
  sufficient, since it implies the remainder). E CANNOT specify
  either of the assignments used in the previous two months.

Re-enact Rule 2542, "Favour Award" (Power=2.0), with the following
text:

  The following officers CAN by announcement award Favours in the
  listed Parties, but SHALL NOT do so except as required by rule.

  - Arbitor and Referee: the Party holding Justice.
  - ADoP: the Party holding Efficiency.
  - Assessor: the Parties holding Legislation and Participation.
  - Clork: all Parties.

  When a player judges a CFJ, the Arbitor SHALL, in a timely
  fashion, award that player 3 Favours in the Party holding Justice.
  When a player's Finger-Pointing leads to a Card award, or when the
  Referee issues Summary Judgement, the Referee shall award a Favour
  in the Party holding Justice to the responsible player.

  Complexity is an office switch, tracked by the ADoP, with values 0, 1
  (default), 2, and 3. The ADoP CAN, without 2 Objections, set the
  Complexity of an office. As part of eir weekly duties, the ADoP
  SHALL award to each officeholder a number of Favours in the Party
  holding Efficiency equal to the Complexity of that Office.

  Whenever the Assessor resolves an Agoran decision:
  - If the decision was to adopt a proposal, and it was ADOPTED, e
    SHALL immediately award the proposal's author a number of
    Favours in the Party holding Legislation equal to the proposal's
    AI, rounded up.
  - For each voter who voted on that Agoran decision and did not
    already receive this type of award earlier in the same Agoran
    week, e SHALL award that player 2 Favours in the Party holding
    Participation.

  Any player CAN spend 2 coins to gain a Favour in the Party holding
   Economy.

  As part of eir weekly duties, the Clork SHALL award, to the
  Advisor of a Politician holding one of the below Posts, 3
  Favours in the corresponding Party:
  - Loner: Platonic Isolationists
  - Drunk: New Punchbowl Reformers
  - Mystery: Costume Conservatives
  - Wild One: Substance Use Liberals
  - Hat Rack: Official Raving Monster Looney Party

Re-enact Rule 2543, "Post Powers" (Power=2.0), with the following
text:

  The Creep CAN by announcement, but no more than once per Agoran
  week, increase eir own Stress Level by 1 in order to increase the
  Stress Level of another specified Politician by 2.

  The Schmoozer CAN by announcement, but no more than once per
  Agoran week, change the Party of a specified other Politician to
  the next Party in order, wrapping around.

  The Enforcer CAN, no more than once per week, with Support from at
  least one other Politician not in the Row-Reduced Echelon, remove
  a specified Row Echelon Politician from eir Post. E must specify
  the supporting Politician when doing so, or it is INEFFECTIVE.
  Upon doing so, both the Enforcer and supporting Politician's
  Stress Levels are increased by 1.

Set the Complexities of the offices as follows:
- ADoP: 2
- Arbitor: 2
- Assessor: 3
- Astronomor: 2
- Clork: 2
- Distributor: 0
- Herald: 2
- Prime Minister: 1
- Promotor: 2
- Referee: 2
- Registrar: 2
- Rulekeepor: 3
- Speaker: 1
- Tailor: 1
- Treasuror: 3

Enact a new rule "Get This Party Started" (Power=2.0) with the
following text:

  The Clork CAN, by announcement, and SHALL, in a timely fashion
  after this rule is enacted:
  - Create 20 Politicians, 4 in each Party, specifying their names;
  - Increase each Politician's Stress Level by twice eir Rank;
  - Assign one Politician to each Post, chosen at random;
  - Randomly assign Policies to Parties (obeying the cyclic order
    restriction); then
  - Cause this rule to repeal itself.

  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, while this rule is in
  effect, it provides the only mechanism by which Politicians can be
  created, Posts or Policies assigned, Stress Levels changed.
  Moreover, rules to the contrary notwithstanding, Favour cannot be
  created.
