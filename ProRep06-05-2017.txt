ID: pp1
Title: Readr's Digest
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Ienpw III
Co-author(s):


Enact a new rule entitled "Reader's Digest": {
  There exists an elected office called Digestive System. "Digestibility" is a
  singleton switch tracked by the Digestive System with possible values
  "MONTHLY" and "WEEKLY"; the Digestive System can flip this by announcement.

  The Digestive System SHALL regularly issue a report which accurately
  summarizes the state and activities of Agoranomic throughout the relevant
  period. This report need not be comprehensive, but will contain that
  information, as assessed by the Digestive System, which would be of the
  greatest relevance or importance for a player who had been inattentive to the
  state of the nomic during the relevant period. If Digestibility is MONTHLY,
  the relevant period is the preceding month; if it is WEEKLY, it is the
  preceding week.
}

Title: No Sneakiness
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Gaelan
Co-author(s):


Create a rule “No Sneakiness” with the following text: {
  If the rules specify that an action may be performed by sending a message to
  a public forum, any attempts to perform the action in a way that is clearly
  intended to prevent others from detecting the action (such as by embedding it
  in another, longer message) are INEFFECTIVE.
}

Title: Deregistration and Assets
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: o
Co-author(s): Aris


Amend rule 2485, "You can't take it with you", by changing its title to
"You Can't Take It With You", then by changing the text to read, in
full:

   "Heir" is a person switch, tracked by the Registrar, whose value is
   either Agora (the default value), or a player other than emself, or
   an Organization. A player may flip eir Heir by announcement.

   When a player is deregistered, e automatically pays all of eir
   Shinies and transfers all of eir Estates to eir Heir, immediately
   before deregistration.

Amend rule 2461 ("Death and Birth of Organizations") by changing its
power to 2, then by adding the following paragraph between the
paragraph beginning "If an Organization's Income is ever lower [...]"
and the paragraph beginning "If a player's Expenditure is at most
[...]":

   Immediately before an Organization is destroyed, it automatically
   pays all of its Shinies to Agora, and transfers all of its Estates
   to Agora.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: pp4
Title: Organization Integration and Stamp Collecting
Adoption index: 1.2
Author: nichdel
Co-author(s):


Amend "Organizations" by replacing the second, third, and fourth
paragraphs with:

   Players may become members of an organization by announcement as
   specified by the charter of the organization. Players may stop being
   a member of an organization by announcement.

   An organization may cause any player to stop being a member as
   specified in its charter.

[Remove Budget and make org membership more flexible.]

Amend "Death and Birth of Organizations to read, in full:

   The Administrative Fee is 5 shinies.

   An organization is "In Bad Standing" if it a) has no members or b)
   was not created this month and has not paid the Administrative Fee to
   Agora.

   If an organization is In Bad Standing for more than 7 days, then any
   player CAN destroy it by announcement, and the Secretary SHALL do so
   in a timely fashion if the situation persists.

   Any player CAN create an Organization by announcement by paying the
   Administrative Fee to Agora and specifying a name for the
   Organization that is unique among Organizations and a Charter.

[Replaces Budget with the Administrative Fee. Combined with giving org's
more control over their membership, it allows for orgs to raise money
and pay the fee in whichever way seems appropriate to them. Also removed
the limits on org membership and creation, because the price should be
a good enough limiters.]

Amend "Organization Restructuring" by removing the text "Budget or", and
removing the paragraph starting with "2.", then changing "3." to "2.".

[Budget cleanup]

Enact a power 1 rule titled "Stamps" with the following text:

   Stamps are a type of asset tracked by the Secretary. Each Stamp is
   identified by the person or organization that created the Stamp.
   Stamps created by the same person or organization are fungible.

   The Stamp Price is always 4 times the current Pending List Price.

   Once per month any player MAY, by announcement, pay Agora the Stamp
   Price, in shinies, to create one Stamp in eir possession. Once per
   month any player MAY, by announcement and as specified by the
   organization's charter, pay Agora the Stamp Price, in shinies, to
   create one Stamp in its possession.

   Any player MAY, by announcement, destroy a specified Stamp in eir
   possession. Any player MAY, by announcement and as specified by the
   organization's charter, destroy a specified Stamp in its possession.
   Whenever an organization or player destroys a Stamp in eir
   possession, Agora SHALL pay em the Stamp Price.

   When a player has in eir possession at least one Stamp created by 15
   different players or organizations then e may win by announcement,
   specifying each stamp e possesses. When a player does so
   successfully, all Stamps in eir possession are destroyed.

[This implements what I described previously. Stamps are both a
speculative currency, with a changing value month-to-month, and a
valuable win condition. Also note that with the org changes, a single
player could create all the Stamps e needs, but it'd be more expensive
than gaining them via trade due to the Administrative fee.]

Create the power-1.5 rule “Internal State” with this text: {
  An Agency or Organization’s Internal State is state that is defined by the
  Agency or Organization’s text (Power or Charter), but not by any rules.

  An Agency or Organization has a Responsible Player for each part of its
  Internal State; the Responsible Player SHALL publish a weekly report
  describing that state. The portion of such a report that describes this state
  is self-ratifying.

  The responsible player for all of an Agency’s state is that agency’s Head. An
  Organization’s Charter must define a Responsible Player for all of its state;
  any player can destroy an organization which does not do so with 1 week
  Notice.
}

Title: Judicial Reform v2
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Gaelan
Co-author(s): Aris, Quazie


Amend R991 “Calls for Judgement” by replacing the last paragraph with {

  “Judge Status” is a player switch tracked by the Arbitor in eir monthly
  report,  with valid values of “Narrow” (default) and “Wide.” A player may
  flip eir own Judge Status by announcement.

  When a CFJ has no judge assigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any player to be its
  judge by announcement, and SHALL do so within a week, but CANNOT do so if
  fewer than 2 days have passed since the CFJ was initiated. The players
  eligible to be assigned as judge are players except the initiator and the
  person barred (if any) who fulfill one of these requirements:

    1. Eir Judge Status is set to Narrow, and they have publicly declared
    Interest in the CFJ.

    2. Eir Judge Status is set to Wide, and they have not publicly declared
    Disinterest in the CFJ.

  The Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all interested players
  have reasonably equal opportunities to judge. If a CFJ has no judge assigned,
  then any player eligible to judge that CFJ CAN assign it to emself Without 3
  Objections.

  If there are no eligible judges for a CFJ for a period of 2 weeks, any player
  CAN judge it as DISMISS with 2 days Notice.
  }

For all players who have been assigned a CFJ within the past 2 weeks, flip their
Judge Status to Wide.

   docile, or apathetic;

   such docility, in the long-term, is fully AGAINST OUR NATURE;

BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED:
