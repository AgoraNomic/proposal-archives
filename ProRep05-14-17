Change Rule 1367 to read in full:

  Certain patent titles are known as degrees.  The degrees are

  - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
  - Bachelor of Nomic                  (B.N.)
  - Master of Nomic                    (M.N.)
  - Doctor of Nomic History            (D.N.Hist.)
  - Doctor of Nomic Science            (D.N.Sci.)
  - Doctor of Nomic Philosophy         (D.N.Phil.)

  Degrees are ranked in the order they appear in this rule, with degrees
  listed later being ranked higher.  A specific degree CANNOT be awarded
  to any person more than once.

  A specified degree CAN be awarded with 2 Agoran Consent, and SHOULD
  only be awarded for the publication of an original thesis of scholarly
  worth (including responses to peer-review), published with explicit
  intent to qualify for a degree. Persons wanting a degree MUST request
  a mentor from the Herald before having made substantial progress on
  eir thesis. The Herald SHOULD coordinate the finding of a mentor for
  any person requesting one. The mentor SHOULD answer questions of the
  mentee and assist in the writing of eir thesis. The mentor SHOULD
  coordinate the peer-review process for the thesis.

Title: Pending List Price Adjustment
Adoption Index: 1.0
Author: nichdel
Co-author(s):

Amend Rule 2445 by replacing the second, thirdand fourth paragraphs with:

      Pending List Price is an integer switch, tracked by the Promotor,
      whose default value is 5. At the beginning of every month, the
      Pending List Price is set to nine-tenths of the mean of the price
      paid for each proposal pended in the previous month, rounded
      down. If less than 2 proposals were pended in the previous month,
      the Pending List Price is set to its default.

      Any player CAN pay Agora a specified amount, which is no less
      than the Pending List Price, to flip a proposal's imminence to
      "pending" by announcement. If the specified amount is less than
      the Pending List Price, then the attempt to pay is  INEFFECTIVE,
      and the proposal's imminence is not flipped.

[Basically just combines Pending Minimum and Pending List. The simpler
math also means that the price tends to end up a tiny bit higher than
the previous scheme.]

Title: Granular Paydays (v3)
Adoption Index: 1.0
Author: nichdel
Co-author(s): Aris, o, G.

[v3: added the clarification of 'duty-fulfilling' reports]

[v2: Changed the switches to be natural, fixed not specifying what
offices are paid, and deleted a typo that suggested the report was paid
instead of the player.]

Flip the Payrate of every office to 2.

Amend 2484 (Payday) to read, in full:

      Payrate is a natural office switch, tracked by the ADoP, with a
      default value of 2. Report Rate is a natural office switch,
      tracked by the ADoP, with a default value of 2.

[Add in Report Rate, which can be adjusted by-office.]

      At the start of each month, if Agora's Balance is not 0 or less,
      Agora SHALL pay each player 10 shinies.

[Nothing changed here.]

      Immediately afterward, for each duty-fulfilling report published
      last month (in chronological order of publication), Agora SHALL
      pay the publisher of the report the Report Rate for the office
      the report is associated with unless paying would leave Agora's
      balance at a negative value.

[Pay out for published reports before offices, in a way similar to how
offices are paid. It's very important to note that, if Report Rates
were not equal, it'd be possible to pay the 1st and 3rd reports but not
the 2nd, if the 2nd would make Agora's balance negative but the 3rd
would not.]

      Immediately afterward, for each office (first in ascending order
      of Payrate, then in descending alphabetical order of office
      name), Agora SHALL pay the holder of the office that office's
      Payrate value unless paying would leave Agora's balance at a
      negative value.

[This paragraph is rewritten to hopefully be more clear, but it is
functionally the same except for changing '0 or less' to 'negative'.]
