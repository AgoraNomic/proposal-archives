ID: 8177
Title: Side-Game Suspension Act (v3)
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: D Margaux, G.

Enact a new power 3.0 rule, entitled "Side-Game Suspension", with the
following text:


  1. The Spaaace Rules are defined to be Rules 2588, 2589, 2590, 2591, 2592,
     2593 and 2594.

  2. The Politics Rules are defined to be Rules 2533, 2534, 2535, 2536, 2537,
     2538, 2539, 2540, 2586, 2542, and 2543.

  3. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the Spaaace Rules are suspended and
     have no force or effect until Spaaace is Revived.

  4. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the Politics Rules are
     suspended and have no force or effect until Politics is Revived.

  5. A player CAN with 2 support Revive Spaaace (unless Spaaace has already
     been Revived); that player is thereby installed into the office of Astronomor.

  6. A player CAN with 2 support Revive Politics (unless Politics has already
     been Revived); that player is thereby installed into the office of Clork.

  7. If Politics and Spaaace have both been Revived, then any player CAN cause
     this Rule to repeal itself with Notice.

  8. Any player CAN with Agoran Consent trigger this Rule.  When this Rule is
     triggered, the following events happen in order: (a) the Politics Rules are
     automatically repealed in ascending numerical order (unless Politics has been
     Revived), (b) the Spaaace Rules are automatically repealed in ascending
     numerical order (unless Spaaace has been Revived), and (c) this Rule is
     automatically repealed.
