If rule 2456 (“The Treasuror”) does not already contain it, add the following
paragraph to the end of that rule:

  The Treasuror CAN flip the floating value once a week by announcement. As part
  of eir weekly duties, e SHALL flip the Floating Value to the number of Shinies
  owned by Agora; e SHALL NOT ever set it to a different value.
  E SHOULD do this while publishing eir weekly report. If the Treasuror
  discovers that e last flipped the floating value to an incorrect value and e
  would not otherwise be able to set it again yet, e CAN and SHALL set the value
  to what it should have been set to in the first place by announcement.

OFFICIAL PROPOSAL


Create the following Power-2 Rule "Zombies":

  Master is a secured player switch with possible values of any
  player, and Agora.  Every player's default master is emself;
  rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a player CAN always flip
  eir own master to emself by announcement.

  A player whose master is not emself is a Zombie. A zombie's
  master, if another player, is allowed to act on behalf of the
  zombie (i.e. as the zombie's agent) to perform LEGAL actions.

  If a player has not made a public announcement in the past
  60 days, then any player CAN flip that player's master to
  Agora by announcement.

  Each zombie whose master is another player has an untracked
  switch indicating whether the zombie Owes a Scare to Agora,
  with values FALSE (default) and TRUE. All such switches are
  flipped to TRUE at the beginning of each month.  A zombie's
  master CAN flip that zombie's switch to FALSE by causing the
  zombie to perform a scary public action for the announced
  purpose of satisfying this scare debt.  If that switch for a
  given zombie is TRUE at the end of a month, then within the
  next seven days any player can flip that zombie's master to
  Agora by announcement.

  This switch is of course the zombie's Boo Lien switch.

OFFICIAL PROPOSAL


Re-enact Rule 1885 (power-1) with a title "Zombie Auctions" and the
following text:

  Whenever a zombie has Agora for a master and an auction for it
  is not underway or been won in the last seven days, then the
  Registrar CAN and SHALL, in a timely fashion, put the specified
  zombie up for auction by announcement. Each auction ends seven
  days after it begins.

  During an auction, any player who is not a zombie CAN bid a
  number of Shinies for the specified zombie by announcement.

  The winner of the auction, if any, is the player who bids the
  highest number of shinies, with ties broken in favor of the
  earlier bidder.  The winner CAN and SHALL, in a timely fashion,
  flip the zombie's master to the winner by announcement, if e
  pays Agora the amount of the bid for the explicit and sole
  purpose of fulfilling this requirement. If there are no bids,
  the auction has no winner.

  If a zombie being auctioned ceases to have Agora as a master at
  any time between the initiation of the auction and the winner
  becoming the zombie's master (or failing to do so in a timely
  fashion after the auction), then the auction has no winner, and
  any obligations to pay for the zombie are voided.

Title: A Most Ingenious Paradox
Adoption index: 1.7
Author: Alexis
Co-authors:


Text in square brackets is not a part of this proposal and has no
effect.

Enact a new power-1 rule entitled "Win by Paradox":

  If a CFJ has been assigned a judgment of PARADOXICAL continuously
  for at least 7 days, and e has not done so already in respect of
  that CFJ, then that case's initiator CAN, by announcement, win the
  game.

  A player who wins in this fashion SHOULD submit a proposal to
  prevent the paradox from arising again.

Amend rule 591 by replacing:

  The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
  the truth or falsity of the statement at the time the inquiry case
  was initiated (if its truth value changed at that time, then its
  initial truth value is used):

with:

  The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
  the facts and legal situation at the time the inquiry case was
  initiated, not taking into account any events since that time:

[This is to prevent changing facts not related to truth or falsity, e.g.
availability of information, from affecting outcomes.]

and by replacing:

  * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
  if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
  reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
  answered with another valid judgement.

with:

  * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
  if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
  reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
  answered with another valid judgement. DISMISS is not
  appropriate if PARADOXICAL is appropriate.

and by appending to the end:

  * PARADOXICAL, appropriate if the statement is logically
    undecidable as a result of a paradox or or other irresovable
    logical situation. PARADOXICAL is not appropriate if IRRELEVANT
    is appropriate, nor is it appropriate if the undecidability
    arises from the case itself.

[The reference to IRRELEVANT is to prevent multiple wins from the same
paradox.]

Amend 'Estate Auctions' by renaming it 'Auctions', by replacing the
first paragraph with:

  begins.
