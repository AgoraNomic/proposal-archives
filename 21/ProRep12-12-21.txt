Author: Jason
Co-author(s):


Amend Rule 2438 by appending the following to the paragraph
beginning "For each type of Ribbon":
{

  Laudability is a secured person switch with non-negative integer possible
  values, defaulting to 0, tracked by the Tailor as part of eir monthly
  report. When a person owns more types of ribbons than eir Laudability,
  eir Laudability is set to the number of types of ribbons e owns.

}

Amend Rule 2480 by replacing:
{
  A player who owns at least N types of Ribbon CAN Start a Rank N
  Festival, where N is an integer greater than Agora's Festivity,
  with 4 support from players who own at least N types of Ribbon.
  Upon doing so, Agora's Festivity is flipped to N. Exception: A
  player CANNOT do so if Agora's Festivity has had a value greater
  than or equal to N within the past 21 days.

  A person who owns a number of types of Ribbon equal to or greater
  than Agora's Festivity is known as Festive. Other persons are not
  Festive.
}
with:
{

  A person whose Laudability is greater than or equal to Agora's
  Festivity is Festive. Any other person is not Festive.

  A player who would be Festive if the Festivity was N CAN Start a
  Rank N Festival, where N is an integer greater than Agora's
  Festivity, with 4 support from other players who would be Festive
  if the Festivity was N, except that a Rank N Festival CANNOT be
  started if Agora's Festivity has had a value grater than or equal
  to N in the past 21 days. Upon a Rank N Festival starting, Agora's
  Festivity is flipped to N.

}

to the number of existing types of ribbon:
