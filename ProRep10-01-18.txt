Title: Buried Intent Prevention Act

[Comment:  Several months ago, Corona tried to smuggle an intent to
declare apathy in the text of a lengthy Treasuror report.  Someone
objected, but I think that would have been EFFECTIVE if it had not
been noticed.  This proposal is meant to prevent that scam.]

Amend Rule 1728 ("Dependent Actions") to add the following paragraph
after the paragraph numbered 6:

  7.  If the intent was announced in a message that contains a
  report required by these Rules, the first line of the message states:
  "This message contains at least one announcement of intent to perform
  a dependent action."
