[This proposal implements a 3 coin, 2 apple reward for each captured
stone, possibly livening up the board]

Amend the rule 1998 "Land Topology" to read in full:

Two Units of Land are Adjacent if they have the same Latitude, and their
Longitudes differ by exactly one; or they have the same Longitude, and
their Latitudes differ by exactly one.

Land Unit A is said to be connected to Land Unit B if it is possible to
reach B by moving only to adjacent Land Units of the same Land Type,
starting from A.

[Here I changed color to Land Type, as color is not defined. So far, it
didn't break anything, as no LUs were to be changed into Aether]

A set Land Units is said to be a Subgroup if all of these Land Units have
the same Land Type are connected to each other.

A Subgroup is said to be a Group if no set exists such that:
1) Its elements are all Land Units of that Subgroup and at least one Land
Unit not an element of that Subgroup.
2) It is a Subgroup.

[Group = a group of stones in Go]

Amend the rule 2022 "Land Transfiguration" to read in full:

[Changing it so that it happens automatically]

At the end of the second Eastman week of each Agoran Month, the following
happens in sequence:

  1. Every Land Unit, with a preservation switch of False that is not
     directly connected to a unit of Aether, or is not connected by its
     own type to a unit of Aether, shall be transformed to Aether.

     For every Land Unit that has its type changed to Aether by this
     procedure, the player who most recently changed the Land Type of any
     Land Unit such that it is an element of the Full Group of the transformed
     Land Unit or adjacent to any of the Land Units of the Full Group of the
     transformed Land Unit, among the players who aren't Cartographor, receives
     3 coins and 2 apples.

  2. Any entities whose locations are on land units so transformed
     shall have their locations set to (0, 0).

  3. If any land unit so transformed is not property of Agora, it
     becomes property of Agora.

  The Cartographor SHALL announce all of these changes in a timely manner.
