      assign a valid judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so
      in a timely fashion after this becomes possible.  If e does not,

      time limit expires, unless the judge assigns a valid judgement
      in the mean time.

[Allows deputisation to remove late judges by adding a SHALL]


Amend Rule 991 (Calls for Judgement) by appending the following
paragraph:

      The Arbitor's weekly report includes a summary of recent
      judicial case activity, including open and recently-judged
      cases, recent judicial assignments, and a list of players
      interested in judging.

[Easiest way to fix the Arbitor's pay, but not just a make-work
report - in the past, regular Arbitor reports have been useful to
keep players informed about the state of judgements and the courts,
which promotes more ongoing clarity in the game state].

This proposal CANNOT create a pledge, other than via clauses that begin "Create
a pledge".

Amend rule 2450 ("Pledges") to read, in full:

  {
    Pledges are an indestructible fixed asset. Ownership of pledges
    is restricted to persons. The Referee is the recordkeepor of
    pledges. Creating, destroying, modifying, and transferring
    pledges are secured.

    To "pledge" something is to create a pledge with those terms. A
    person CAN pledge by announcement to create a pledge e owns.

    To "retract" (syn "withdraw") a pledge is to destroy it. A
    person CAN retract a pledge e owns without objection.

    To "call in" a pledge" is to destroy it. A player CAN call in
    any pledge with Agoran Consent, if e announces a reason the
    Terms of the pledge should be considered broken. Support for an
    intent to call in a pledge is INEFFECTIVE unless the supporting
    player explicitly confirms the reasons that the pledge should
    be considered broken.

    It is ILLEGAL to own a pledge when it is called in.

    the explanation to be valid for this pledge, it should be fully

    order to understand the explanation (So please, include all
    source info in the explanation).

Amend Rule 2162 (Switches) by appending the following paragraph:

  Attempting to flip an instance of a switch to a value it already
  has does not flip the switch.  However, if a person is REQUIRED
  to flip a switch instance to a value it already has, then either
  attempting to do so using the required mechanism, or announcing

Title: Numerical switches v2
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: G.
Co-authors:


[A generalization of natural switches, explicitly defining how
mathematical operations work on them, that allows for much greater
flexibility in writing switch operations all around, and suggests
some intriguing future switches on generalized number sets].


Create the following rule, "Numerical Switches", Power-2:

  If a switch is defined as being associated with a specified set
  of numbers (a numerical switch), then the possible values for
  that switch are the numbers in that set.  In particular, a
  "natural" switch is a switch with possible values of the
  non-negative integers.  If a limit is further defined, the
  possible values are the numbers of the set within the specified
  limits.

  If 0 is in the specified values for a numerical switch and no
  default value is otherwise specified, 0 is the default value
  for that switch.

  If the rules describe mathematical operations to be used in
  flipping an instance of a numerical switch, the operations are
  interpreted as having common-sense mathematical application to
  determine that instance's resulting value.  For example,
  "increasing a switch instance by M" is equivalent to "flipping
  a switch instance from its current value N to the value N+M".
  If the specified mathematical operation would result in a value
  outside that switch's defined set, the flipping CANNOT be
  performed, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.


Amend Rule 2162 (Switches) by deleting:

  A natural switch is a switch with a default value of 0, unless
  the rules explicitly specify a different default value.  If the
  rules define an upper limit for the switch, then the possible
  values are non-negative integers not greater than that limit,
  otherwise the values are the non-negative integers.


[The rule creation happens before the deletion.  Briefly, there will
be two identical definitions for Natural switches.  However, that's
better than a brief period where they are undefined!  If there's some
weird conflict between the definitions in that instant, the older
rule takes precedence until that text is deleted].

Title: Such is Karma v2
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: 天火狐



Create the following Rule, 'Such is Karma', Power-1:

  Karma is a person switch tracked by the Herald in eir Weekly
  Report.  Karma is an Integer switch.  The Community Chest also
  has an instance of the Karma switch.

  A player CAN publish a Notice of Honour.  For a Notice of Honour
  to be valid, it must:
       1.  Be clear that it is a Notice of Honour, and be the
           first valid Notice of Honour that player has published
           in the current week;
       2.  Specify any other player to gain karma, and provide a
           reason for specifying that player; and
       3.  Specify any player to lose karma, and provide a reason
           for specifying that player.
  When a valid Notice of Honour is published, the player specified
  to gain karma has eir karma increased by one, and the player
  specified to lose karma has eir karma decreased by one. Raising
  one entity's karma while lowering another's in this manner is
  considered to be a "transfer" of karma.

  A player's positions in Court are defined as follows:
       - Any player with a karma of 7 or greater is a Samurai.
       - Any player with a karma of -7 or less is an Eta.
       - The player with the highest karma (if any) is the Shogun.
       - The player with the lowest karma (if any) is the
         Honourless Worm.
  Each player's positions in Court are part of of the Herald's
  Weekly Report.


Create the following Rule, 'Karmic Balance', power-1:

  In a timely fashion after the beginning of each Quarter, the
  Herald CAN and SHALL by announcement, perform the following
  tasks in order:
        1.  Halve (rounding towards 0) the Karma of every
            Unregistered person.
        2.  Set the Karma of the Community Chest such that the sum
            of all Karma switch instance values in the game is
            equal to 0.

  While the Karma of the Community Chest is not equal to 0, the
  Herald CAN and SHALL publish a Notice of Honour specifying the
  Community Chest as a gainer or loser in place of a player; to
  be valid, it must be specified such that the result would move
  the Karma of the Community Chest closer to 0.  For selection
  players in such transactions, the Herald SHOULD use standards
  of behavior and game balance befitting the spirit of the game.


[Note:  since only one Notice of Honour per player per week, the
Herald's requirement to tap the Community Chest takes place of eir
voluntary Notice of Honour - the Herald doesn't get to do both in
a week].
