Rename rule 2550, "Bidding" to "Secret Bidding" Amend that rule
by replacing "A person authorized to bid on an Auction CAN do so by
announcement," with "A person authorized to bid on an Auction CAN do
so by secretly communicating with that Auction's announcer,". Also,
remove the text " A person CAN withdraw their bid on an Auction by
announcement. If a person submits a bid on an Auction, all bids
previously placed  on that Auction by that person are withdrawn." Also
add in a new paragraph "Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no
Announcer may ever bid on an Auction they are Announcing unless they
do so in a verifiably secret way either in the same post as the
Auction initiation,
or up to two days before its initiation. Whichever method they choose, the
method must be verifiably datable to before or during the auction's initiation,
and revealed only at the auction's end.".

Amend rule 2551 "Auction End" by removing the text ", or immediately if no
bid has been placed or withdrawn in the last 96 hours". Also, replace
the text "In the same message, e SHALL include the a list of all the
bids on the Auction and the winner(s) (if there are any) of the
Auction." (by the way, typo) with "In the same message, e SHALL
include an unamended list of the auction-related communications e
privately received, and the bids contained within those
communications, and the winner(s) (if any) of the Auction. E shall
also list the times at which those communications were received.
Failing to correctly and fully relate the results of an Auction as an
Auction announcer is the Class-9 Crime of Auction Obfuscation, and
Auction announcers SHALL NOT so fail. Revealing information about the
auction before its end either privately or publicly is also the same crime, if
performed by Auction announcers, who SHALL NOT do so.". Also amend that rule
by replacing "The winner of a lot SHALL pay the Auctioneer the number of
the Auction's currency equal to eir bid," with "The winner of a lot
SHALL pay the Auctioneer the number of the Auction's currency equal to
the bid one lower than eir bid, plus one unit of that currency".
