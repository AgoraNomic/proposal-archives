Amend Rule 2445 (How to Pend a Proposal) by appending the following
paragraph:

  The holder of an Office CAN Rubberstamp a proposal for that
  specified office, without 3 objections, if no other proposal has
  been rubberstamped for that office in the current Agoran month.
  When rubberstamped, the proposal becomes an official proposal
  associated with that office. Rubberstamping SHOULD only be used to
  make rule or gamestate corrections associated with the duties of
  that office.

[A proposed compromise between the "allow without objection fix
proposals" and the "pay for every proposal including bugfixes" camps]

Title: 5 auctions
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Trigon

Amend rule 2004 "Land Auctions" by replacing the entire text with:

  Every Agoran Week, if the number of Units of Private Land is less
  than one half the total number of units of Land, a number of
  Public, non-Aether, Preserved Land Units are chosen using the
  following process:

  1. If there exist more than 5 such units, the Cartographor SHALL
     choose exactly 5 of them.

  2. If there exist 5 or fewer such units, all are automatically
     chosen.

  For each land unit selected by the process described above, the
  Cartographor CAN and SHALL initiate an auction with it as the only
  lot. For this auction, the announcer is the Cartographor, the
  auctioneer is Agora, and the minimum bid is 1 coin.

Title: Q*Bert the Second
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Trigon
Co-authors: G., Corona


Amend rule 1995 "Land Types" by doing the following:

  Replacing the first paragraph with:

    Each Unit of Land has a Land Type switch, tracked by the
    Cartographor. Possible values are:

    1. Black
    2. White
    3. Gray
    4. Aether (the default)

    Changes to Land Type switches are secured. To "change the type"
    of, or to "transform" a Unit of Land is to flip its Type switch. A
    “Unit of X” is a Unit of Land whose Land Type switch has the value
    X.

  and replacing the first word of the final paragraph with "Alternating
  Land Type".

Re-enact rule 2046 (Power=1.0) "Q*Bert (tm)" [1]

Rename rule 2046 to "Q*Bert"

Amend rule 2046 by replacing its text, in its entirety, with:

  Q*Bert is an entity which has a location. Q*Bert CAN be on a unit
  of Aether.

  Q*Bert has a color switch, tracked by the Cartographor, whose
  possible values are all defined Land Type other than Aether or
  Gray. The default value is Black. When Q*Bert moves to a Land
  Unit, if the current type of the unit is not the same as Q*Bert's
  color switch, Q*Bert changes that space's type to the value of eir
  color switch.

  Every week, the Cartographor CAN and SHALL move Q*Bert using the
  following process:

  1. If Q*Bert is on the same Land Unit as another entity, the
     Cartographor SHALL select a Land Unit adjacent to Q*Bert's
     current position and move em there.

  2. Otherwise, the Cartographor SHALL select a Land Unit whose
     longitude and latitude both differ from Q*Bert's by exactly
     one.

  If, after Q*Bert has moved, e is on a Preserved Land Unit, the
  Cartographor SHALL repeat the process above, moving Q*Bert until e
  is no longer on a Preserved Land Unit.

  If the type of the Land Unit that Q*Bert is located on is
  switched by an entity that is not Q*Bert, Q*Bert's color switch is
  set to that type instead.

  Whenever Q*Bert is moved to (0, 0), the Cartographor CAN and SHALL
  choose a random Land Type that is an allowed value of Q*Bert's
  color switch and set Q*Bert's color switch to it.

  When referring to Q*Bert, entities CAN replace the "*" with any
  punctuation character or spell it with a lowercase letter "b"
  (i.e. Q-Bert, Q^bert)
