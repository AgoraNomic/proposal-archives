ID: 8033
Title: Gray Land and the Fountain
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Kenyon
Co-authors: Aris, Cuddle Beam, Gaelan, Trigon


Amend "Land Types" (Power=2.0):
    Replace "whose values are "Black", "White", and "Aether"", with the
    text "whose values are "Black", "White", "Gray", and "Aether""

Create a new rule "Facility Categories", (Power=2.0):
    A facility's Category is a switch whose possible values are
    “Production”, “Processing”, “Monument”, and “Miscellaneous”.  An “x
    facility”, where x is a Category, refers to a facility that has
    Category switch set to x.

Amend "Asset Generation with Facilities" (Power=2.0) to read the following:
  When an Production or Processing facility creates assets, the assets
  are added to the facility's possession. The rule that creates an
  Production or Processing facility CAN specify a carrying capacity for
  assets. If, at any time, the amount of an asset in the possession of an
  Production or Processing facility exceeds that asset's carrying
  capacity, an amount of that asset is destroyed until the amount of that
  asset in the possession of the facility is equal to its carrying
  capacity.

  At the end of every Agoran Week, Agora creates a number of assets in a
  Production facility specified by the rule which creates the facility.

  At the end of every Agoran Week, Agora destroys any refinable assets in
  the possession of each Processing facility that that facility can
  change into refined assets and replaces them with a corresponding
  number of refined assets to be specified by the rule that creates the
  facility.

  A player can take a number of assets from an Production or Processing
  facility's inventory by announcement if eir location is the same as
  the facility's and the following criteria are met:
   1. if the facility is built on unconserved Public Land, none.
   2. if the facility is built on preserved Public Land and less than
   four days have passed since assets were created in the facility most
   recently, e must not have taken any assets from the inventory of
   another facility located on a preserved Land Unit within this Agoran
   week.
   3. if the facility is built on Communal Land, e must be a party to
   that contract and the text of the contract must permit em to do so.
   4. if the facility is built on Private Land, e must own the facility,
   or the owner must have consented.

Amend "Facility Ranks" (Power=2.0) to read the following:
  Rank is a facility switch tracked by the Cartographor defaulting to 1.
  Its possible values include all integers between 1 and 5, inclusive.

  If a facility specifies upgrade costs, a player CAN increase the rank
  of a facility e owns that is at eir location by exactly 1 by
  announcement by paying any upgrade costs of the facility for that
  specific rank. If no upgrade costs are specified for a facility, a
  player CANNOT increase the rank of that facility unless specified in
  other rules.

Create a new rule "Facility Colors" (Power=2.0):
  A facility's Allowed Land Types is a switch with allowed values of a
  list of allowed values of the Land Type switch, with a default value of
  {"Black", "White"}. A facility may not have a Parent Land Unit whose
  Land Type is not an element of their Allowed Land Types. If an action
  or set of actions would cause a facility to be created with a Parent
  Land Unit whose Land Type is not an element of its Allowed Land Types,
  that action or set of actions fails. If a facility's Parent Land Unit's
  Land Type is flipped to a color that is not in that facility's Allowed
  Land Types, that facility is destroyed.

  An “x facility”, where x is a Land Type or list of Land Types, refers
  to a facility that has the Allowed Land Types switch set to x.

Create a new rule "Gray Land" (Power=2.0):
  Gray Land is preserved and owned by Agora. If Land becomes Gray Land,
  it, along with any facilities with it as their Parent Land Unit, is
  transferred to Agora.

Amend “Actions in Arcadia” (Power=1.0) by replacing the first two element
in the list with:
  1. 1 apple to move from one Land Unit to an adjacent Unit if their Land
  Types are the same or one of them is gray, and the destination is not
  Aether;

  2. 2 apples to move from one Land Unit to an adjacent Unit if their
  Land Types differ, neither is gray, and the destination is not Aether;

Create a new rule "Monument Facilities" (Power=1.0):
  For each type of Monument facility, there may only be one instance of
  that facility in existence at any one time. An action CANNOT cause an
  Monument facility to exist while another Monument facility of the same
  type is already in existence.

Create a new rule "The Fountain" (Power=1.0):
  A fountain is a Gray Monument facility. A fountain has no upkeep cost.

Create a new rule "Wishing Fountain", (Power=1.0):
  If a player's location is the same as a fountain, e CAN destroy a coin
  to Throw A Coin into the fountain. This does nothing, unless specified
  in another Rule. A player MAY announce what e wishes for when e Throws
  A Coin.

Set (0, 0)'s Land Type to "Gray".
Create a fountain at (0, 0) belonging to Agora.
