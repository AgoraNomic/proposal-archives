Title: Blots v1.0
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: Aris


[I'm keeping this MODDULAR.  Meaning I'm changing Cards to blots.  I'm
NOT plugging into land/currencies.  Instead I'm making a simple time-
based expunging system ('Removing Blots') that is a stub for adding
Temples or whatnot once this all works and once we've thoroughly
debugged land.]


Create the following Rule, Blots, power-2:

  Blots are an indestructible fixed currency with ownership
  restricted to persons. A person with 1 or more blots is Impure, a
  person with 0 blots is Pure. An impure unregistered person is a
  Fugitive.

  To Levy a Fine of N on a person, where N is a positive integer,
  is to create N blots in eir possession by announcement. To Expunge
  a blot is to destroy it by announcement. If expunging blots would
  reduce a person's blots to less than 0, their blots are instead
  reduced to 0 but the cost of expunging, if any, is not reduced.

  Levying fines and destroying blots are each secured with a power
  threshold of 1.7.

  The Referee is an office, and the recordkeepor for blots.


Create the following Rule, Penalties, power-3:

  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an impure person CANNOT win
  the game.

  The voting strength of a player on an Agoran Decision is reduced
  by 1 for every 3 blots in eir possession.


Create the following Rule, Removing Blots, power-1.7:

  If a player has neither gained blots nor expunged any blots from
  emself in the current Agoran week, e CAN expunge 1 blot from
  emself by announcement.

  At the beginning of each quarter, half (rounded down) of each
  fugitive's blots are destroyed.



Amend Rule 2478 (Vigilante Justice) to read:

  A player CAN by announcement, but subject to the provisions of
  this rule, Point eir Finger at a person (the perp) who plays the
  game, citing an alleged violation of the rules by that person.

  When a player Points a Finger, the investigator SHALL investigate
  the allegation and, in a timely fashion, SHALL conclude the
  investigation by:

  - Imposing the Cold Hand of Justice on the perp, as described
    elsewhere; or

  - if e believes that no rules violation occurred or that it would
    be ILLEGAL to levy a fine for it, announcing the Finger Pointing
    to be Shenanigans.

  The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
  Pointing. When a Finger, other than the Arbitor's, is Pointed over
  an allegation related to the official duties or powers of the
  Referee, then the Arbitor CAN, by announcement, take over the
  investigation and thereby become the investigator.

  The Referee CANNOT Point eir Finger. The Arbitor CANNOT Point eir
  Finger at the Referee.


Create the following Rule, Sentencing Guidelines, power 1.7:

  When the rules authorize an investigator to impose the Cold Hand
  of Justice for a violation, e CAN do so by levying a fine on the
  perp with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 2x the base value of the
  violation, within the following guidelines:

  - If the violation is described by the rules as a Class N crime,
    then N is the base value; otherwise the base value is 2.

  - The fine SHOULD be reduced to the degree that the violation is a
    minor, accidental, and/or inconsequential infraction.

  - The fine SHOULD be increased to the degree that the violation is
    willful, profitable, egregious, or an abuse of an official
    position.

  Optionally, in the same message in which e imposes justice, the
  investigator CAN specify that the violation is forgivable,
  specifying up to 10 words to be included in an apology.  If the
  investigator does so, the perp CAN, in a timely fashion, expunge P
  blots from emself, where P is the minimum of the value of the fine
  and 3, by publishing a formal apology of at least 200 words and
  including all the specified words, explaining eir error, shame,
  remorse, and ardent desire for self-improvement.


Amend Rule 2479 (Official Justice) to read:

  The Referee CAN, subject to the provisions of this rule, impose
  Summary Judgment on a person who plays the game by levying a
  fine of up to 2 blots on em. Summary Judgement is imposed on the
  Referee's own initiative, and not in response to any official
  proceeding.

  The Referee CANNOT impose Summary Judgement more than three times
  a week.


Amend Rule 2531 (Referee Accountability) to read:

  Any attempt to levy a fine is INEFFECTIVE if it does not include
  (1) value of the fine in blots, (2) the name of the person being
  fined (the perp), and (3) the specific reason for the fine, or if
  it attempts to levy a fine on a person for an action or inaction
  which e (more likely than not) did not commit, or if it attempts
  to levy a fine for an action or inaction which is not prohibited
  by law, or if it attempts to levy a fine with a value which is
  blatantly and obviously unsuited to the conduct which constitutes
  the reason for its levy or to the person to which it is being
  levied, or if it is made more than 14 days after the conduct
  constituting the reason for the fine, or if it attempts to levy a
  fine to a player who has already been levied a fine for the
  conduct constituting the reason for the levy.

  If the Referee attempts to levy three or more INEFFECTIVE fines in
  a week, any player CAN, with two support, issue a writ of
  Impartial Arbitration Restoration, immediately making the position
  of Referee vacant. When a writ of Impartial Arbitration
  Restoration is issued, the ADoP SHALL initiate an election for the
  Referee within a timely fashion.


Increase the power of Rule 2531 (Referee Accountability) to 2.


Amend Rule 2529 (Medals of Honour) by replacing:
  not had a Card issued to em.
with:
  not had a fine levied on em.


Amend Rule 2451 (Executive Orders) by replacing:
  - Dive (Referee): The Prime Minister issues a specified Card to a
    specified player. Notwithstanding rule 2426, the reason for the card
    MAY be any grievance held by the Prime Minister, not necessarily a
    violation of the rules, against the person to whom the Card is
    issued.
with:
  - Dive (Referee): The Prime Minister levies a 2 Blot fine on a
    specified player. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
    reason for the fine MAY be any grievance held by the Prime
    Minister, not necessarily a violation of the rules, against the
    person to whom the fine is levied.


Amend Rule 2523 (Contracts as Agreements) by replacing its entire second
paragraph with:
  As an exception to the provisions of the previous paragraph and
  the circumstances in which fines would ordinarily be appropriate,
  a person levying a fine under this rule MAY and CAN validly
  consider the equitable interests of justice and interests of the
  game, including the importance of the observation of contracts, as
  a mitigating or aggravating circumstances when levying a fine.
  Such a person MAY, CAN validly, and SHOULD also consider the
  instructions of the contract or contracts in question when levying
  a fine.


Amend the Rule entitled "Paydays" by replacing the text:
  e was not issued any Cards other than Green for eir conduct
  in that office
with:
  no unforgivable fines were levied on em for eir conduct in that
  office


Repeal Rule 2426 (Cards)
Repeal Rule 2477 (The Referee)
Repeal Rule 2474 (Green Cards)
Repeal Rule 2506 (Blue Cards)
Repeal Rule 2427 (Yellow Cards)

Lines beginning with hashmarks ("#") and comments in square brackets ("[]")
have no effect on the behavior of this proposal. They are not part of any rules
created or amended herein, and may be considered for all game purposes to
have been removed before its resolution.

Amend Rule 105, “Rule Changes”, by replacing

  "If the reenacting proposal provides new text for the rule, the rule
  must have materially the same purpose as did the repealed version;
  otherwise, the attempt to reenact the rule is null and void.”

with

  “If the reenacting proposal provides new text for the rule, the
  rule SHOULD have materially the same purpose as did the repealed version."

Amend Rule 2143, "Official Reports and Duties", by appending the text

  "A convergence is any change to the gamestate that has, in accordance with
  the rules, been designated as such. A change to the gamestate SHOULD NOT be
  designated as a convergence unless it is designed to resolve gamestate
  ambiguity. Designating a change as a convergence is secured; any player CAN
  do so with 3 Agoran Consent. When officeholders provide historical
  information, they NEED NOT accurately document the changes made by the
  convergence or related ambiguities, provided that they instead note
  that the convergence occurred. Information about a convergence (but not
  the resulting state) is inherently uncertain and is thus excluded from
  self-ratification."

as a new paragraph at the end of the rule.

[I imagine the form of notation would be something along the lines of
"Gamestate converged to..."]

Designate all changes made from here to the next occurrence the mark "~~~"
as convergences.

If Rule 2599 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following
text; if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it
to have the following text: {

 If a player has not received a Welcome Package since e most
  recently registered, any player CAN cause em to receive one by
  announcement.

  When a player receives a Welcome Package, Agora creates the
  following assets in eir possession:

  1. 10 coins
  2. 5 lumber
  3. 5 stones
  4. 10 apples
  5. 3 papers
}

If no rule titled “Paydays” exists, create it at power 2 with the following
text; if it exists but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Whenever a Payday occurs, the following events happen in order:

  1. The following assets are created in the possession of each
     player:
     A. 10 coins
     B. 5 apples
     C. 2 papers

  2. For each office, if a single player held that office for 16 or
     more days in the previous month and e was not issued any Cards
     other than Green for eir conduct in that office during that
     time, the following assets are created in the possession of
     that player:
     A. 5 coins
     B. 1 corn

  The occurrence of Paydays is secured.  At the beginning of each
  month, a Payday occurs.
}

If Rule 1993 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Arcadia is a land entirely defined by the Arcadian Map (the Map).
  The Map is the term for the set of all Land Units.

  The Map divides Arcadia into a finite, discrete number of Units of
  Land, or simply Land. Each Unit of Land is an indestructible asset
  specified by an ordered pair of integers known as its Latitude and
  Longitude.

  Every unique ordered pair of integers within the limits defined in
  the Rules for Latitude and Longitude signifies an existent Unit of
  Land. No other Units of Land exist. Units of Land CAN only be
  created or destroyed by changing the limits of Latitude and
  Longitude defined in the Rules.

  All values for Latitude and Longitude MUST lie between -6 and +6,
  inclusive.

  The Total Land Area of Arcadia is the number of existent Units of
  Land defined by permissible Latitude and Longitude pairs.
}

If Rule 1994 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Any existent Land for which ownership has not been explicitly
  changed belongs to Agora.

  Land belonging to Agora is called Public Land. Land belonging to
  a contract is called Communal Land. Land belonging to any other
  entity is called Private Land. Together, Communal Land and Private
  Land are called Proprietary Land.
}

If Rule 1995 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Each Unit of Land has a Land Type switch, tracked by the
  Cartographor, whose values are "Black", "White", and "Aether" (the
  default). Changes to Land Type switches are secured. To "change
  the type" of, or to "transform" a Unit of Land is to flip its Type
  switch. A “Unit of X” is a Unit of Land whose Land Type switch has
  the value X.

  When existent Land has not had its Type changed as explicitly
  permitted by the Rules, or has a Type that is not currently
  defined by the Rules, it is considered to have the Land Type of
  Aether. Rules to the contrary nonwithstanding, Units of Aether
  CANNOT be transferred from Agora, or owned by any entity other
  than Agora.

  If Proprietary Land becomes Aether, the Cartographor SHALL
  transfer it to Agora in a timely fashion, destroy any facilities
  on the Land Unit, and set all other switches to their default
  values.

  Type is a singleton switch with the values of Black and White,
  defaulting to Black. When an act specifies that an alternating
  land type is to be used, the current value of the Alternating Land
  Type switch is used, and the switch is set to the next value of
  the switch.
}

If Rule 1996 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  The Cartographor is an office; its holder is recordkeepor for the
  Land of Arcadia.

  The Cartographor's Weekly Report shall include:

  1. the ownership and land type of all existing land;
  2. all changes in the ownership and land type of existing land
     since the most recent report;
  3. the location for the previous week and the current week of each
     entity with a defined location;
  4. the next alternating land type;
  5. all facilities and their parent land units; and
  6. a list of all preserved land units.
}

If Rule 1996 is not titled “The Cartographor”, retitle it “The Cartographor”.

If Rule 1998 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Two Units of Land are Adjacent if they have the same Latitude, and
  their Longitudes differ by exactly one; or they have the same
  Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by exactly one.

  Land Unit A is said to be connected to Land Unit B if it is
  possible to reach B by moving only to adjacent Land Units of the
  same color, starting from A.
}

If Rule 1999 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Location is a player switch, tracked by the Cartographer, whose
  values are ordered pairs of integers where the first value is a
  valid Latitude, and the second is a valid Longitude. The default
  Location is (0, 0).

  To "move" a player is to flip that player’s Location switch to the
  Latitude and Longitude of the destination.

  No other Entity can have a location unless it is defined in a rule
  other than this one. Changes to the Location of an Entity are
  secured. If an Entity is specified by this Rule as having a
  defined Location, but its Location has not been explicitly set or
  changed, its Location is set to (0, 0).
}

If Rule 2003 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Players CAN destroy:

  1. 1 apple to move from one Land Unit to an adjacent Unit if their
     Land Types are the same and the destination is not Aether;

  2. 2 apples to move from one Land Unit to an adjacent Unit if
     their Land Types differ and the destination is not Aether;

  3. 2 apples to set Land Type of a Land Unit which e owns to any
     Land Type other than Aether, whether or not e is located at
     that Land Unit.

  4. 3 apples to set the Land Type of a Land Unit that is adjacent
     to the Entity's current location, is of type Aether, and is
     owned by Agora, to an alternating Land Type.

  5. 4 apples to set the Land Type of a Land Unit that is adjacent
     to the Entity's current location, is of type Aether, and is
     owned by Agora, to a Land Type of eir choice.

  6. 6 apples to set the Land Type of a Land Unit that is of type
     Aether, and is owned by Agora, to an alternating Land Type.

  Players CAN, while performing the above actions, substitute 3
  apples for 1 corn.
}

if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  Every Agoran Week, if the number of units of Private Land is less
  than one half the total number of units of Land, an auction SHALL
  be initiated. For this auction, the announcer is the Cartographor,
  the auctioneer is the Cartographor, the lots are chosen as such:

  1. if there exist at least 5 Units of non-Aether Land in the
     possession of Agora with the preservation switch set to False:
     any 5 such Units of Land, to be chosen by the Cartographor,
     each Land Unit in a separate lot;

  2. if there exist fewer than 5 Units of non-Aether Land in the
     possession of Agora: all such Units, each land unit in a
     separate lot;

  and the minimum bid is 1 coin.
}

If Rule 2022 is not currently enacted, re-enact it with the following text;
if it is enacted but does not have the following text, amend it to have the
following text: {

  During the second Eastman week of each Agoran Month, the
  Cartographor SHALL perform the following actions in sequence, and
  report these changes:

  1. Every Land Unit, with a preservation switch of False
     that is not directly connected to a unit of Aether, or is not
     connected by its own type to a unit of Aether, shall be
     transformed to Aether.

  2. Any entities whose locations are on land units so transformed
     shall have their locations set to (0, 0).

  3. If any land unit so transformed is not property of Agora, it
     becomes property of Agora.
}

If Rule 2022 is not titled “Land Transfiguration”, retitle it

Amend the Rule titled “Facilities” by making the following changes: {

  Replace the last paragraph with "Facilities always have the same owner as
  their parent land unit. If the owner of a facility is ever not the same as
  that of its parent land unit, it is transferred to the owner of its parent
  land unit.”

  Append the following to the second paragraph: “Facilities on proprietary land
  can be destroyed by the owner by announcement. Facilities on public land

  When the Rules state that a person or persons win the game,
