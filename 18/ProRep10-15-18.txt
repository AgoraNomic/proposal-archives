[We were expecting at least a few players to be in these bands, but
currently, none are. This proposal fixes that by lowering the threshold
to something more consistent with our experience.]

Amend Rule 2510, Such is Karma, by changing the text

  "- Any player with a karma of 7 or greater is a Samurai.

   - Any player with a karma of -7 or less is an Gamma."

// MAIN IDEA:  Let different officers award specifically-relevant titles.
//             Having specific goals may better promote their use than an
//             open-ended "the Herald can award anything" (which e still
//             would be able to do).
//
//             Also, turn the Silver Quill concept into a broader set of
//             annual awards.

// Ideas for awards very welcome!  Especially for not-currently included
// offices (Treasuror, Cartographer, PM, Distributor).  But also, if
// some of these titles seem like trivial clutter, please critique.
// Titles themselves are a mix of some old, some new.


Create the following Rule, Official Patent Titles, power=1:

  The following Patent Titles CAN be awarded by the indicated
  Officers with 2 Agoran Consent.  In order to balance the history,
  dignity, spontaneity, and serendipity of the awards, the Herald,
  Speaker, and Prime Minister are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to provide
  their support or objections, and reasons for doing so, reasonably
  quickly after any such intents are announced.

   - Tapecutter, awardable by the Rulekeepor to the author of an
     adopted proposal that significantly reduces, streamlines, or
     simplifies the ruleset.

   - Scamster, awardable by the Referee to any player who has shown
     great enthusiasm, persistence, or skill in the perpetrating of
     scams without breaking any Rules.

   - Hard Labor, awardable by the ADoP to any player who holds 2+
     offices for 3+ continous months while performing eir official
     duties in a timely and conscientious manner that promotes the
     gameplay of the office.

   - MacGyver, awardable by the Assessor to the author of an adopted
     proposal that fixes serious bugs in the ruleset, especially if
     the fix uses existing rules text in novel and unexpected ways,
     or to a judge for similarly using rules text to resolve an
     apparent bug without the need for legislative action.

   - Bard, by Speaker the award should given be, to persons who
     publish repeated creative wit or poetry.

   - Necromancer, awardable by the Registrar to any player who makes
     such sufficient persistent legal use of zombies that rules need
     to be amended to prevent such practices.

   - Tycoon, awardable by the Treasuror to any player who executes a
     novel economic or contractual enterprise that has a significant
     impact on the game, especially if it involves leveraging synergies
     for win-win outcomes for the benefit of multiple players.

   - Helping Hand, awardable by any Officer to any person not holding
     that office who puts substantial labor into aiding in the duties
     of that office, without consideration of any other reward they
     might receive.

  The Herald is also ENCOURAGED to proactively recommend or, as
  otherwise permitted, award these titles when appropriate,
  especially if the potential awardee is the officer emself.


Create the following Rule, Annual Awards, power=1:

  April is hereby designated Awards Month.

  The following Patent Titles CAN be awarded by the indicated
  Officers with 2 Agoran Consent, provided the intent to make
  the awards is announced during awards month, and the award is
  made to commemorate acts performed in the previous Agoran year.
  The full name of each awarded Patent Title is [Title Below] NNNN,
  where NNNN is the year each act was performed.

  Each indicated Officer SHOULD award these titles to 1-2 persons
  each year, and SHOULD solicit an open call for nominations and
  discussion before making these awards. The Herald SHALL note any
  additional information indicated below as part of eir report of
  Patent Titles.

    - Silver Quill, awardable by the Promotor to the author of a
     proposal of outstanding merit and influence on the game
     (additional information: ID Number of the proposal).

    - Wooden Gavel, awardable by the Arbitor to the judge of a CFJ
     or series of CFJs with a strong and foundational impact on the
     judicial precedents of Agora (additional information: ID Numbers
     of the judgements).

    - Golden Glove, awardable by the Tailor to the player who made the
     most interesting, successful, and/or competitive series of moves
     while attempting to win or get substantially ahead in the game.

    - Employee of the Year, awardable by the ADoP to the persons
     who put the most persistent hard labor into keeping the game
     going through the performance of Officers' duties (additional
     information: offices held by the awardee during that year).
