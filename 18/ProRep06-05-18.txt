Title: Pledge Simply
Adoption index: 1.7
Author: G.
Co-authors:


[The Asset-nature of pledges is complicated and serves no purpose;
if pledges are to be used for out-of-Agora agreements, the Agoran
Consent constraint makes no sense as it's not a voting matter].

Amend Rule 2450 (Pledges) to read in full:

  If a Player makes a clear public pledge (syn. Oath) to perform
  (or refrain from performing) certain actions, then breaking the
  pledge within the pledge's time window is the Class N crime of
  Oathbreaking, where N is 2 unless the pledge explicitly states
  otherwise.  The time window of a pledge is 60 days, unless
  the pledge explicitly states otherwise.

  If breaking the pledge harms specific other parties, the Referee
  SHOULD solicit the opinion of those parties in determining an
  appropriate fine.

  The Notary's Weekly Report includes a copy of all pledges that
  are within their time window, and the dates the pledges were
  made.

All pledges that existed as assets the instant before this Proposal
took effect are hereby made pledges under the current version of
Rule 2450, with their creation dates equal to their date of creation
as assets.

Title: Zombie Overhaul v1.0
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: G.

[TODO:  Check proposals adopted since the last SLR for conflicts]

Create the following Rule, Zombie Life Cycle, power=3:

  Any player CAN, with Notice, flip the master switch of an active
  player who has not made a public announcement in the past 60 days
  to Agora.

  Resale is a secured natural switch for zombies, tracked by the
  Registrar, with a default value of 2. Whenever a zombie's master
  switch is flipped to a player other than emself, eir resale value
  is decreased by 1.

  A zombie with a resale value of 0 CANNOT have eir master switch
  flipped to a player other than emself, rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding.

  Any player CAN, with Notice:
    - If a zombie has been a zombie for the past 90 days and not had
     Agora for a master during any of that time, flip the zombie's
     master switch to Agora;
    - If a player is master to more than one zombie, flip the master
     switch of one of that master's zombies to Agora;
    - Deregister a zombie whose master is Agora and who has a Resale
     value of 0.

  The Registrar SHALL track the date that each zombie last belonged
  to Agora in eir weekly report.  The Registrar SHALL perform all
  POSSIBLE actions in the preceding paragraph in a timely fashion
  after first reporting their possibility via the facts in eir
  weekly report.


Amend Rule 2532 (Zombies) to read in full:

  Master is a secured player switch with possible values of any
  player, and Agora. Every player's default master is emself; rules
  to the contrary notwithstanding, a player CAN always flip eir own
  master to emself by announcement.

  A player whose master is not emself is a zombie (syn. inactive);
  all other players are active.  A zombie's master, if another
  player, is allowed to act on behalf of the zombie (i.e. as the
  zombie's agent), except a master CANNOT act on behalf of a zombie
  to:
    - initiate, support, object to, or perform a dependent action;
    - act on behalf of that zombie's zombies;
    - bid in a zombie auction;
    - enter a contract, pledge, or other type of agreement;
    - deregister.

  A zombie's master CAN flip that zombie's master switch to Agora by
  announcement.

  If a master causes a zombie to perform an ILLEGAL action, the
  master commits the Class 4+N Crime of Masterminding (where N is
  the class of the illegal action).

  If a active player who was a zombie has not received a Welcome
  Package since e most recently ceased being a zombie, and if eir
  resale value was less than 2 at any point during eir most recent
  time as a zombie, then any player CAN cause em to receive a
  Welcome Package by announcement.


Every active player who was a zombie with a master other than Agora at
some point in time since Oct 1, 2017 is hereby awarded a Welcome
Package.


Amend Rule 2531 (Referee Accountability) by replacing the . in the
first paragraph with:
  , or if it attempts to levy a fine on a zombie for an action
  that its master performed on its behalf.


Amend Rule 1885 (Zombie Auctions) by replacing:
  (2) an auction for it is not underway, and (3)
with:
  (2) is not a lot in an ongoing auction, (3) has a resale value
  greater than 0, and (4)


and by replacing:
  The Registrar is the announcer, and the minimum bid is 1.
with:
  The Registrar is the announcer, and the minimum bid is 1.  Rules
  to the contrary notwithstanding, the master of a zombie CANNOT
  bid in a zombie auction. If a player becomes a zombie's master,
  all eir bids in zombie auctions that have not ended are withdrawn.


Amend Rule 869 (How to Join and Leave Agora) by removing:
  If a player has not sent a message to a public forum in the last
  month, then any player CAN deregister em with 3 Agoran Consent.


Repeal Rule 2554 (Zombiception).

omd's master switch is hereby set to omd.

Create the following Rule, The Distributor, power=3:

  The Distributor is an imposed office whose holder is generally
  responsible for the management of the primary Agoran fora.
  The holder CANNOT be changed except Without Objection or by
  proposal.  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
  Distributor's master switch CANNOT be flipped to be other than
  emself, and e CANNOT deregister or be deregistered.


omd is hereby made the Distributor.
