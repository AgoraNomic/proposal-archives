Lines beginning with hashmarks ("#") and comments in square brackets ("[]")
have no effect on the behavior of this proposal. They are not part of any rules
created or amended herein, and may be considered for all game purposes to
have been removed before its resolution.

[This proposal saves allowing contracts to control or auction assets until we
decide to allow them to be persons, which is its own can of worms.]

# 1 Repeal

Destroy all contracts.

Repeal rules 2524, 2526, 2520, 2525, 2522, 2523, 2521, 2527, and 2517, in
that order.

In rule 2545 "Auctions", delete the text "or contract"

In rule 2547 "The Auctioneer", delete the text "or contracts",
change the last comma in the last sentence of the second paragraph
to a period, deleting the all parts of the sentence beyond it, and delete
the last paragraph.

In rule 2548 "The Auction Announcer" delete the text "or contract" and
the last sentence.

In rule 2549 "Auction Initiation", delete all instances of the text
"or contract"

In rule 2550 "Bidding", replace the last comma with a full stop and
delete all text after it, and delete all instances of the text "or
contract"

In rule 2483 "Economics", delete the text "contracts,"

In rule 1994 "Ownership of Land", delete the text "Land belonging to a
contract is called Communal Land." and delete the text "Together,
Communal Land and Private Land are called Proprietary Land." and
replace the text "Land belonging to any other entity is called Private
Land." with "Land belonging to any other entity is called Private Land
(syn. Proprietary Land)

In rule 2561 "Asset Generation with Facilities", delete the text "3.
if the facility is built on Communal Land, e must be a party to that
contract and the text of the contract must permit em to do so." and
renumber the fourth bullet point 3.

# 2 Replacement

Reenact Rule 1742, "Contracts", at power 2.5, with the following text:

  Any group of two or more consenting persons (the parties) may
  make an agreement among themselves with the intention that it be
  binding upon them and be governed by the rules. Such an agreement
  is known as a contract. A contract may be modified, including
  by changing the set of parties, by agreement between all existing
  parties. A contract may also terminate by agreement between all
  parties. A contract automatically terminates if the number of
  parties to it falls below two. For the purposes of this rule,
  agreement includes both consent and agreement specified by
  contract.

  Parties to a contract governed by the rules SHALL act in
  accordance with that contract. This obligation is not impaired
  by contradiction between the contract and any other contract, or
  between the contract and the rules.

  A party to a contract may act on behalf of another party to
  it as allowed in the contract.

Title: Distributed Assets v3
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: G.


Amend Rule 2166, "Assets", to read as follows:

  An asset is an entity defined as such by a document that has been
  granted Mint Authority by the Rules (hereafter the asset's backing
  document), and existing solely because its backing document defines
  its existence. An asset's backing document can generally specify when
  and how that asset is created, destroyed, and transferred.

  The rules collectively have Mint Authority. Contracts have Mint
  Authority. A rule defined asset is public; one defined by a contract
  is private.

  The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
  defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document. That
  entity's report includes a list of all instances of that class and
  their owners. This portion of that entity's report is
  self-ratifying.

Create a power 3.0 rule, entitled "Ownership", with the following text:

  Each asset has exactly one owner. If an asset's backing document
  restricts its ownership to a class of entities, then that asset
  CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity outside that
  class, and is destroyed if it is owned by an entity outside that
  class. The restrictions in the previous sentence are subject to
  modification by its backing document. By default, ownership of an
  asset is restricted to Agora, players, and contracts.

  If an asset would otherwise lack an owner, it is owned by the Lost
  and Found Department. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
  Lost and Found Department can own assets of every type. Assets owned
  by the Lost and Found Department can be transferred or destroyed
  by any player without objection.


Create a power 3.0 rule, entitled "Asset Actions", with the following text:

  An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by announcement,
  subject to modification by its backing document. An indestructible
  asset is one defined as such by it backing document, and CANNOT be
  destroyed except by a proposal or rule, other than this one,
  specifically addressing the destruction of indestructible assets
  or that asset in particular; any other asset is destructible.

  To "lose" an asset is to have it destroyed from one's possession;
  to "revoke" an asset from an entity is to destroy it from that
  entity's possession.

  An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. given) by
  announcement by its owner to another entity, subject to
  modification by its backing document. A fixed asset is one defined
  as such by its backing document, and CANNOT be transferred; any
  other asset is liquid.

  When a rule indicates transferring an amount that is not a natural
  number, the specified amount is rounded up to the nearest natural
  number.

Create a power 3.0 rule, entitled "Currencies", with the following text:
  A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing
  document. Instances of a currency with the same owner are
  fungible.

  The "x balance of an entity", where x is a currency, is the number
  of x that entity possesses. Where it resolves ambiguity, the asset or
  currency being referred to is the currency designated as "Agora's
  official currency", if there is one.


Create a power 3.0 rule, entitled "Fee-based Actions":

  If the Rules associate payment of a set of assets (hereafter
  the fee for the action; syns: cost, price, charge) with performing an
  action, that action is a fee-based action.

  If the fee is a non-integer quantity of a fungible asset, the actual
  fee is the next highest integer amount of that asset.

  To perform a fee-based action, an entity (the Actor) who is
  otherwise permitted to perform the action must announce that e
  is performing the action; the announcement must specify the
  correct set of assets for the fee and indicate intent
  to pay that fee for the sole purpose of performing the action.

  Upon such an announcement:

    - If the Rules specify a recipient for the fee, and the Actor
      CAN transfer that specified fee from emself to the recipient,
      then that fee is transferred from the Actor to the recipient
      and the action is performed simultaneously;

    - If the Rules do not specify a recipient, and the Actor CAN
      destroy the specified fee in eir possession, then that fee
      in eir possession is destroyed and the action is
      performed simultaneously.

    - Otherwise, no changes are made to asset holdings and the
      action is not performed.

  If the Rules define a fee-based action but the specified
  set of assets is the empty set, then the action can be performed by
  announcement, but the announcement must include that there
  is an (empty or 0) fee for the action.

In Rule 2003, amend the text "Players CAN destroy:" to read "Players CAN
pay the listed fee to take the associated action:"

[I think that's the only rule that actually needs to be changed over.
Most of the other phrasings in the ruleset seem as if they'll transfer
over on there own. The only other case that I can see that won't is the
last paragraph of Rule 2551, "Auction End", which isn't really designed
to work in a fee-based way, and so actually shouldn't be switched over.]

For the avoidance of doubt, all assets existing under the old system continue
to so under the new system, and if they would not otherwise do so, new assets
are created to replace them.

Title: Deregulation Act v2
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: G.


Repeal Rule 2494, "The Regkeepor".

Amend Rule 2493, "Regulations", to read in full:

  A regulation is an textual entity defined as such by this rule,
  and under the authority of an officer, known as its Promulgator.
  A regulation must be authorized by a rule (its parent rule) in
  order to exist. It has only the effect that rule explicitly
  gives it.

  A regulation CAN be enacted, amended, and repealed as specified
  by its parent rule. By default, a Promulgator can enact or amend
  a regulation with 2 Agoran Consent and repeal a regulation by
  announcement. Regulations are tracked in their Promulgator's
  weekly report.


Change the power of Rule 2493 to 3.0.

Amend Rule 2565, "Preserved Land", by changing the text

  "The preservation switch CAN be set in a regulation promulgated
   by the Cartographor without 2 objections"

to read

  "The preservation switch CAN be set by the Cartographor without
  2 objections".

Amend Rule 2125 by changing all instances of the text "restricted" (case
insensitive) to read "regulated", preserving the capitalization of the first
letter.

For the avoidance of doubt, all regulations existing under the old system
continue to so under the new system, and if they would not otherwise do so,
new regulations are created with as similar properties as possible
to replace them.
