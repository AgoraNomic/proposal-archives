Title: Agoraculture v. 2.0
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: babelian

Enact a rule with power 2.0 titled “Agoraculture” with the following text:

  Estates have a Farm switch with potential values Farmed and Unfarmed,
  defaulting to Unfarmed. If a player that owns an Estate pays 20 shinies to
  Agora in the first two Agoran weeks of an Agoran month expressly for flipping
  the Farm Switch on that Estate, e CAN, by announcement, flip or keep the Farm
  switch at Farmed. An Estate with its Farm switch flipped to Farmed shall be
  known as a Farm. A player who owns a Farm is a Farmer.

  Comestibles are a new type of entity than can be used to bolster voting
  strength. A Farmer CAN, by announcement, produce a net number of
  N Comestibles, where N is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10x,
  where x is the number of Farms the Farmer owns. Comestibles MUST be priced
  from 5 to 10 shinies. In eir announcement, the player MUST mention the number
  of comestibles of each price produced.  (For example, one such announcement
  could be: “I produce 3 comestibles priced at 5 shinies and 4 comestibles
  priced at 7 shinies.”)

  A player with voting strength greater than zero CAN, by announcement, purchase
  as many Comestibles as e wish from a specific Farmer. However, Comestibles
  expire within three Agoran months of their purchase. A player CAN, by
  announcement, use as many non-expired Comestibles e own as e wish when e vote
  on an Agoran Decision.  If the net price of the sacrificed Comestibles is from
  10N to 10N+9 where N is some positive integer less than 5, the player
  adds N to eir current voting strength, before being rounded as necessary.
  Comestibles MUST only be used once.

  A Farmer CANNOT use eir own Comestibles. When a Comestible expires it is no
  longer counted as belonging to the player who owned it. When a Farmer does not
  sell all of eir Comestibles in an Agoran month, e CANNOT produce more
  Comestibles than he sold in that Agoran month in the next Agoran month. Any
  unsold Comestibles CANNOT be resold in the following Agoran month.

  A Farmer MUST pay 20 shinies per Agoran month for each Farm e owns. If e does
  not pay 20 shinies per Agoran month specifically for a Farm in the first two
  Agoran weeks of an Agoran month, that Farm’s Farm switch will be set to
  Unfarmed.

  If an Estate transfers to Agora, a player, or an organization, its Farm Switch
  is set to Unfarmed regardless of its former state.

Enact a Rule with power 2.0 titled “Agoraculturor” with the following text:

  The Agoraculturor is an office that keeps track of all farmers and Farm
  switches. E SHALL publish the Agoracultural Weekly Report (AWR), a weekly
  report of all farmers and the number of farms they own. E SHALL also publish
  a list of all player's Comestibles and their date of purchase. The
  Agoraculturor SHALL also flip all Farm switches when necessary.

Let babelian be the Agoraculturor.
