Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Political Parties", reading as
follows:

  There are 5 Parties, in order:

  - Platonic Isolationists
  - New Punchbowl Reformers
  - Costume Conservatives
  - Substance Use Liberals
  - Official Raving Monster Looney Party

  Politicians are entities; each Politician has a name and an
  associated Party. Politicians exist only as specified by the
  rules. Creating, altering, or destroying Politicians is secured.

  If there are ever fewer than 20 Politicians, then the Clork CAN
  and SHALL, by announcement, create a new Politician, specifying
  eir Party and name. The Party must be selected at random from:

  - If any Party has fewer than 3 Politicans, the Party or Parties
    with the fewest.
  - Otherwise, the Parties with fewer than 5 Politicians.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Clork", reading as follows:

  The Clork (pronounced "clark") is an office. The Clork's weekly
  report includes:
  - a list of all Politicans with their names and Parties.
  - the assignment of Policies to Parties.

  The portion of a document purporting to be a Clork's report
  containing the above information is self-ratifying.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Echelon Forms", reading as follows:

  A Post is a position which can be held by at most one Politician.
  Each Politican can hold at most one Post at a time. Each Post is
  in an Echelon, which has an associated Rank. The Echelons, and
  their Posts and Ranks, are as follows:

  Chamber of Power (Rank 5):
  - Host
  Upper Echelon (Rank 3):
  - Planner
  - Enforcer
  - Organizer
  - Creep
  Row Echelon (Rank 1):
  - Schmoozer
  - Decorator
  - Loner
  - Drunk
  - Mystery
  - Wild One
  - Hat Rack

  Each Politician who holds a Post is in the Echelon of that post;
  other Politicians are in the Row-Reduced Echelon, which has Rank
  0. Likewise, the Rank of a Post or Politician is the Rank of their
  Echelon.

  If a rule provides that a Post can take an action, then the
  Advisor of the holder of that Post CAN take that action. If there
  is no such player, and the Post is required to take that action,
  then the Clork CAN do it prior to any deadline for its
  performance. After a deadline for a Post to perform an action, any
  player CAN take it.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Taken Under Advisement", reading as
follows:

  Advisor is a Politician switch, tracked by the Clork, with
  possible values all players and none (default). For each
  Politician, Influence over <Politician> is a natural player
  switch, tracked by the Clork.

  A player CAN, by announcement, spend Favours in a Party to gain
  Influence over that Politican, depending on the Politician's
  Echelon:
  - Chamber of Power: 3 Favours for 2 Influence
  - Upper Echelon: 1 Favour for 1 Influence
  - Row Echelon: 2 Favours for 3 Influence
  - Row-Reduced Echelon: 1 Favour for 2 Influence

  If a player has more Influence over a given Politician than any
  other player, e can Advise that Politican by announcement. When e
  does so, if no other player Advises the same Politician later in
  the same Agoran week, then at the start of the next Agoran week,
  that player becomes that Politician's Advisor.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Balloons", reading as follows:

  Balloons are a fixed currency, tracked by the Clork, with
  ownership restricted to players. Creation or destruction of
  balloons is secured.

  At the start of each Agoran week, after Advisors are flipped:
  - For each player, if e owns more Balloons than e was awarded by
    this procedure at the start of the previous week, any excess
    Balloons are destroyed.
  - Each player is awarded Balloons equal to the sum of the Ranks of
    the Politicians for which e is Advisor.
  - The Decorator's Advisor, if any is awarded one additional
    Balloon.

  A player CAN, by announcement, spend a Balloon e owns to increase
  eir voting strength on a specified Agoran Decision, other than one
  with an adoption index of 3 or higher, by 1.

  A player CAN, by announcement, spend Balloons equal to the sum of
  the Ranks of all Posts in order to win the game. Upon doing so,
  all eir Influence switches are set to 0.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Party Favours", reading as follows:

  For each Party, there is a currency called Favours in that Party.
  Ownership of Favours is tracked by the Clork. Ownership of Favours
  is restricted to players.

  A player CAN, by announcement, spend 3 Favours in a single Party
  to award another player 2 Favours in that Party.

  A player CAN, by announcement, spend 3 Favours in a single Party
  to gain a Favour in another specified Party.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Retirement", reading as follows:

  Stress Level is a natural Politician switch, tracked by the Clork.
  At the start of each Agoran week, each Politician's Stress Level
  is increased by eir Rank. If, after this procedure, a Politician's
  Stress Level is 20 or greater, the Politician announces retirement
  and is destroyed at the beginning of the following Agoran week.
  The Clork SHALL announce this fact in a timely fashion.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Political Elections", reading as
follows:

  For each Post, Vote for <Post> is a secured Politician switch
  tracked by the Clork, with possible values all Politicians and
  undecided (default).

  The voting strength of a Politician for a Post is defined as
  follows:
  - For an election for Host, Politicians have strength equal to
    their Rank.
  - For an election for an Upper Echelon Post, the Host has strength
    4, and Upper Echelon Politicians have strength 2.
  - For an election for a Row Echelon Post, the Host has strength 3,
    Upper Echelon Politicians have strength 2, and Row Echelon
    politicians have strength 1.
  - The Organizer has voting strength 1 greater than e would have
    based on the above.

  The eligible Politicians in an election for a Post are all
  Politicians in the highest non-empty Echelon below that of the
  Post up for election. The number of votes cast for an eligible
  Politician in an election is the sum of voting strengths for that
  Post of all Politician voting for em; the number of votes cast for
  an ineligible Politician is 0.

  An election for a Post is resolvable if that Post is vacant, there
  is a single Politician with the most votes in that election, and
  either at least four days have passed since either the vacancy or
  since its previous occupant Announced Retirement, whichever was
  first, or if the leader has more votes than the Policitian with
  the second-most, plus the total voting strength of all undecided
  Politicians in that election. When an election for a Post is
  resolvable, any player CAN, by announcement, end the election and
  install the winning Politician (which must be specified or else
  the announcement is INEFFECTIVE) into the Post.

  If a Post is vacant and either has been so for seven days or more
  than eleven days have passed since its previous holder Announced
  Retirement, then the Host CAN and SHALL, in a timely fashion, by
  announcement end the election and install one of the Politicians
  with the most votes into the Post.

  When an election for a Post ends, all Vote switches for that Post
  are set to undecided.

Enact a new power-1 rule entitled "Party Policy", reading as follows:

  There are 5 Policies, in order:

  - Justice: interested in seeing justice served
  - Efficiency: interested in seeing official duties performed
  - Legislation: interested in seeing proposals passed
  - Participation: interested in seeing votes cast
  - Economy: interested in economic activity

  At any time, each Policy is held by exactly one Party. The
  assignments must be in cyclic order of their definitions, wrapping
  from bottom to top. For example, if the Platonic Isolationists
  hold Participation as their Policy, then the New Punchbowl Reformers
  hold Economy, the Costume Conservatives hold Justice, and so on.

  At the start of each Agoran month, the Planner CAN and SHALL, in a
  timely fashion, by announcement, select a new assignment of
  Policies to Parties (specifying the Policy of one Party is
  sufficient, since it implies the remainder). E CANNOT specify
  either of the assignments used in the previous two months.

Enact a new power-1 rule entitled "Favour Awards":

  The following officers CAN by announcement award Favours in the
  listed Parties, but SHALL NOT do so except as required by rule.

  - Arbitor and Referee: the Party holding Justice.
  - ADoP: the Party holding Efficiency.
  - Assessor: the Parties holding Legislation and Participation.
  - Clork: all Parties.

  When a player judges a CFJ, the Arbitor SHALL, in a timely
  fashion, award that player 3 Favours in the Party holding Justice.
  When a player's Finger-Pointing leads to a Card award, or when the
  Referee issues Summary Judgement, the Referee shall award a Favour
  in the Party holding Justice to the responsible player.

  Complexity is an office switch, tracked by the ADoP, with values 1
  (default), 2, and 3. The ADoP CAN, without 2 Objections, set the
  Complexity of an office. As part of eir weekly duties, the ADoP
  SHALL award to each officeholder a number of Favours in the Party
  holding Efficiency equal to the Complexity of that Office.

  Whenever the Assessor resolves an Agoran decision:
  - If the decision was to adopt a proposal, and it was ADOPTED, e
    SHALL immediately award the proposal's author a number of
    Favours in the Party holding Legislation equal to the proposal's
    AI, rounded up.
  - For each voter who has not voted on an Agoran decision resolved
    earlier in the same Agoran week, e SHALL award that player 2
    Favours in the Party holding Participaiton.

  Any player CAN spend shinies equal to the Favour Value to gain a
  Favour in the Party holding Economy.

  As part of eir weekly duties, the Clork SHALL award, to the
  Advisor of a Politician holding one of the below offices, 3
  Favours in the corresponding Party:
  - Loner: Platonic Isolationists
  - Drunk: New Punchbowl Reformers
  - Mystery: Costume Conservatives
  - Wild One: Substance Use Liberals
  - Hat Rack: Official Raving Monster Looney Party

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Post Powers":

  The Creep CAN by announcement, but no more than once per Agoran
  week, increase eir own Stress Level by 1 in order to increase the
  Stress Level of another specified Politician by 2.

  The Schmoozer CAN by announcement, but no more than once per
  Agoran week, change the Party of a specified other Politician to
  the next Party in order, wrapping around.

  The Enforcer CAN, no more than once per week, with Support from at
  least one other Politician not in the Row-Reduced Echelon, remove
  a specified Row Echelon Politician from eir Post. E must specify
  the supporting Politician when doing so, or it is INEFFECTIVE.
  Upon doing so, both the Enforcer and supporting Politician's
  Stress Levels are increased by 1.

Set the Complexities of the offices as follows:
- ADoP: 2
- Agronomist: 1
- Arbitor: 2
- Assessor: 3
- Clork: 2
- Fearmongor: 1
- Herald: 1
- Notary: 2
- Prime Minister: 1
- Promotor: 2
- Referee: 2
- Registrar: 2
- Regkeepor: 1
- Reportor: 1
- Rulekeepor: 3
- Speaker: 1
- Surveyor: 1
- Tailor: 1
- Treasuror: 3

Amend rule 2497, Floating Value, by appending "- Favour Value: 1/10th of
the Floating Value, rounded up." to the list of Derived Floating Values.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Get This Party Started", reading as
follows:
  The Clork CAN, by announcement, and SHALL, in a timely fashion
  after this rule is enacted:
  - Create 20 Politicians, 4 in each Party, specifying their names;
  - Increase each Politician's Stress Level by twice eir Rank;
  - Assign one Politician to each Post, chosen at random;
  - Randomly assign Policies to Parties (obeying the cyclic order
    restriction); then
  - Cause this rule to repeal itself.

  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, while this rule is in
  effect, it provides the only mechanism by which Politicians can be
  created, Posts or Policies assigned, Stress Levels changed.
  Moreover, rules to the contrary notwithstanding, Favour cannot be
  created.

Install Telnaior as Clork.

Title: A Most Ingenious Paradox

Author: Alexis

Text in square brackets is not a part of this proposal and has no
effect.

Enact a new power-1 rule entitled "Win by Paradox":

  If a CFJ has been assigned a judgment of PARADOXICAL continuously
  for at least 7 days, and e has not done so already in respect of
  that CFJ, then that case's initiator CAN, by announcement, win the
  game.

  A player who wins in this fashion SHOULD submit a proposal to
  prevent the paradox from arising again.

  The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on

with:

  The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
  the facts and legal situation at the time the inquiry case was
  initiated, not taking into account any events since that time:

[This is to prevent changing facts not related to truth or falsity, e.g.
availability of information, from affecting outcomes.]

  * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
  if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
  reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be

with:

  * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
  if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
  reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
  answered with another valid judgement. DISMISS is not
  appropriate if PARADOXICAL is appropriate.

and by appending to the end:

  * PARADOXICAL, appropriate if the statement is logically
    undecidable as a result of a paradox or or other irresovable
    logical situation. PARADOXICAL is not appropriate if IRRELEVANT
    is appropriate, nor is it appropriate if the undecidability
    arises from the case itself.

paradox.]
