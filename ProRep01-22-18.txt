[Keeps a very basic shiny system for Contracts and other stuff, but
vastly simplifies it].


Amend Rule 2483 (Economics) to read in full:

  Shinies (singular "shiny", abbreviated "sh.") are an
  indestructible liquid currency, and the official currency of
  Agora.

  The Treasuror is an Office, and the recordkeepor for shinies.

  Whenever a Payday occurs, the following events happen in order:

    1.  For each entity possessing shinies, half of eir shinies
    (rounded up) are destroyed.

    2.  10 shinies are created in the possession of each player.

    3.  For each office, if a single player held that office
    for 16 or more days in the previous month and e was not
    issued any Cards other than Green for eir conduct in that
    office during that time, 3 shinies are created in the
    possession of that player.

  The occurrence of Paydays is secured.  At the beginning of each
  month, a Payday occurs.

  When a person registers who has not been a player at any time in
  the previous 60 days, 10 shinies are created in eir possession.

  The Pend Cost is 3 Shinies.  The CFJ Cost is 1 Shiny.


[
 For any given payday, the total shinies S(t) will be governed by:
  S(t+1) = 10*Players + 3*Offices - 0.5*S(t)
 This has a stable equilibrium at (10*Players+3*Offices)/1.5 (if
 rounding isn't taken into account).
]


All shinies are hereby destroyed.

A Payday hereby occurs.


Amend Rule 2445 (How to Pend a Proposal) by replacing:
  a) spending 1 Action Point, OR

  b) spending the current Pend Cost in shinies.
with:
  a) spending the current Pend Cost in shinies, OR

  b) Without Objection.


Amend Rule 991 (Calls for Judgement) by replacing:
  a) by announcement, and spending 1 Action Point, OR

  b) by announcement, and spending the current CFJ cost in shinies,
     OR

  c) by announcement if e is not a player.
with:
  a) by announcement, if e has not previously initiated any CFJs in
     the current week, OR

  b) by announcement by spending the current CFJ Cost in shinies.


[Everyone, players and non-players alike, gets one CFJ free per week, that
is hopefully sufficiently guarding of justice for everyone - if not can
raise that later.]
