//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Title: Assets v7
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: G., o, nichdel, Publius Scribonius Scholasticus

Reenact rule 2166, Assets (Power = 2), with the following text:

  An asset is an entity defined as such by a rule (hereafter its backing
  document), and existing solely because its backing document defines its
  existence.

  Each asset has exactly one owner.  If an asset would otherwise
  lack an owner, it is owned by Agora.  If an asset's backing document restricts
  its ownership to a class of entities, then that asset CANNOT be gained by or
  transferred to an entity outside that class, and is destroyed if it is owned
  by an entity outside that class (except for Agora, in which case any player
  CAN transfer or destroy it without objection). The restrictions in the
  previous sentence are subject to modification by its backing document.

  Unless modified by an asset's backing document, ownership of an asset is
  restricted to Agora, persons, and organizations.

  An organization's charter CAN specify whether or not that organization is
  willing receive assets or a class of assets. Generally, an organization CANNOT
  be given assets its charter states that it is unwilling to receive. The
  previous provisions of this paragraph do not apply to an asset if the
  organization is required to provide that asset in order to continue existing.

  The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
  defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document.  That
  entity's report includes a list of all instances of that class
  and their owners.  This portion of that entity's report is
  self-ratifying.

  An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by
  announcement, subject to modification by its backing document. An
  indestructible asset is one defined as such by it backing document, and CANNOT
  be destroyed except by a rule specifically addressing the destruction of
  indestructible assets or that asset in particular; any other asset is
  destructible. In circumstances where another asset would be
  destroyed, an indestructible asset is generally transferred to Agora, subject
  to modification by its backing document and the intervention of other rules.

  To "lose" an asset is to have it destroyed from one's
  possession; to "revoke" an asset from an entity is to destroy it
  from that entity's possession.

  An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. payed, given) by its owner to
  another entity by announcement, subject to modification by its backing
  document.  A fixed asset is one defined as such by its backing
  document, and CANNOT be transferred; any other asset is liquid.

  A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing document.
  Instances of a currency with the same owner are fungible.

  The "x balance of an entity", where x is a currency, is the number of x that
  entity possesses. If a rule, proposal, or other competent authority attempts
  to increase or decrease the balance of an entity without specifying a source
  or destination, then the currency is created or destroyed.

  Where it resolves ambiguity, the asset or currency being referred to is the
  currency designated as "Agora's official currency", if there is one.

  Amendments to a backing document shall not be construed to alter, transfer,
  destroy, or otherwise effect any assets defined by that document, unless
  that is their clear intent.

  Assets are always public. [To provide for private contract based assets later]

Change the power of Rule 2166 to 3.0.

Change the rule "Economics" to read in full:

  Shinies (sg. shiny) are an indestructible liquid currency, and the official
  currency of Agora. They may be owned by Agora, any player, or any
  organization. The Secretary is the recordkeepor for Shinies.

  The Secretary CAN cause Agora to pay any player or organization by
  announcement if doing so is specified by a rule.

Amend Rule 2459, Organizations, by adding as a paragraph at the end:

  A member of an Organization CAN perform any action the rules authorize that
  Organization to perform, if the Organization's charter states that doing so
  is Appropriate.

For the avoidance of doubt, all shinies existing under the old system continue
to so under the new system, and if they would not otherwise do so, new shinies
are created to replace them.


Amend the rule "The Surveyor" to have the following text:

  The Surveyor is an office, and the recordkeepor of estates.

Amend the rule "Estates" to have the following text:

  An Estate is a type of indestructable liquid asset, which can be owned by
  players, organizations, and Agora. The following changes are secured:
  creating, modifying, or destroying an Estate; and causing an
  entity to become an Estate or cease to be an Estate.

Amend the rule "Estate Auctions" by changing the paragraph beginning "During
an auction..." to read "During an auction, any player or organization may bid
any number of Shinies by announcement." and removing the break between that
and the next paragraph.

For the avoidance of doubt, all Estates existing under the old system continue
to so under the new system, and if they would not otherwise do so, new Estates
are created to replace them.

Title: Gentle Judicial Updates
Adoption index: 1.7
Author: Quazie
Co-author(s): grok

Create a new rule entitled 'Recusal' Power = 1 with the following text
  {{{
    A judge may recuse emself from a CFJ they are assigned to.

    When a judge recuses emself from a CFJ the following happens:
      1 - The CFJ becomes unassigned
      2 - The recused judge becomes ineligible to be assigned as a judge
          for a week.
      3 - The recused judge SHOULD suggest another judge for the CFJ to
          make the Arbitor's job easier.
  }}}

  Update rule 591 by replacing:
  {{{
      The valid judgements, based on the facts of the case at the time
      the CFJ was initiated, are TRUE, FALSE, and DISMISS.  DISMISS is
      appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
      irrelevant to the game, if insufficient information exists to
      make a judgement with reasonable effort, or the statement is
      otherwise not able to be answered TRUE or FALSE.

  }}}
  with
  {{{
      The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based
      on the truth or falsity of the statement at the time the inquiry
      case was initiated (if its truth value changed at that time,
      then its initial truth value is used):

      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically false

      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and logically
        true

      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement is
        not relevant to the game or is an overly hypothetical
        extrapolation of the game or its rules to conditions that
        don't actually exist, or if it can be trivially determined
        from the outcome of another (possibly still undecided)
        judicial case that was not itself judged IRRELEVANT

      * INSUFFICIENT, appropriate if the statement does not come with
        supporting arguments or evidence, and the judge feels as if an
        undue burden is being placed on em by the lack of arguments and
        evidence.  A CFJ judged as INSUFFICIENT CAN and SHOULD be
        submitted again with sufficient arguments/evidence.

      * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
        if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
        reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
        answered with another valid judgement.

following text
{{{
    Some proposals have minimal consequences, and thus should cost a
    minimal amount to pend, these proposals are known as Trivial Proposals.

    A player may pend a Trivial Proposal by paying 1 Shiny to Agora without

Co-author(s): G., Gaelan, Aris, 天火狐

Replace the text of Rule 2450 with the following:
  {{{
    Breaking a publicly-made pledge is a cardable offense.

    If a publicly-made pledge says that the creator of a pledge will do
    something, without providing a time limit, then e SHALL in a timely manner

Title: Organization Integration and Stamp Collecting
Adoption index: 1.2
Author: nichdel
Co-author(s):


Amend "Organizations" by replacing the second, third, and fourth
paragraphs with:

   Players may become members of an organization by announcement as
   specified by the charter of the organization. Players may stop being
   a member of an organization by announcement.

   An organization may cause any player to stop being a member as
   specified in its charter.

[Remove Budget and make org membership more flexible.]

Amend "Death and Birth of Organizations to read, in full:

   The Administrative Fee is 5 shinies.

   An organization is "In Bad Standing" if it a) has no members or b)
   was not created this month and has not paid the Administrative Fee to
   Agora.

   If an organization is In Bad Standing for more than 7 days, then any
   player CAN destroy it by announcement, and the Secretary SHALL do so
   in a timely fashion if the situation persists.

   Any player CAN create an Organization by announcement by paying the
   Administrative Fee to Agora and specifying a name for the
   Organization that is unique among Organizations and a Charter.

[Replaces Budget with the Administrative Fee. Combined with giving org's
more control over their membership, it allows for orgs to raise money
and pay the fee in whichever way seems appropriate to them. Also removed
the limits on org membership and creation, because the price should be
a good enough limiters.]

Amend "Organization Restructuring" by removing the text "Budget or", and
removing the paragraph starting with "2.", then changing "3." to "2.".

[Budget cleanup]

Enact a power 1 rule titled "Stamps" with the following text:

   Stamps are a type of asset tracked by the Secretary. Each Stamp is
   identified by the person or organization that created the Stamp.
   Stamps created by the same person or organization are fungible.

   The Stamp Price is always 4 times the current Pending List Price.

   Once per month any player MAY, by announcement, pay Agora the Stamp
   Price, in shinies, to create one Stamp in eir possession. Once per
   month any player MAY, by announcement and as specified by the
   organization's charter, pay Agora the Stamp Price, in shinies, to
   create one Stamp in its possession.

   Any player MAY, by announcement, destroy a specified Stamp in eir
   possession. Any player MAY, by announcement and as specified by the
   organization's charter, destroy a specified Stamp in its possession.
   Whenever an organization or player destroys a Stamp in eir
   possession, Agora SHALL pay em the Stamp Price.

   When a player has in eir possession at least one Stamp created by 15
   different players or organizations then e may win by announcement,
   specifying each stamp e possesses. When a player does so
   successfully, all Stamps in eir possession are destroyed.

[This implements what I described previously. Stamps are both a
speculative currency, with a changing value month-to-month, and a
valuable win condition. Also note that with the org changes, a single
player could create all the Stamps e needs, but it'd be more expensive
than gaining them via trade due to the Administrative fee.]

Title: Judicial Reform v2
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Gaelan
Co-author(s): Aris, Quazie


Amend R991 “Calls for Judgement” by replacing the last paragraph with {

  “Judge Status” is a player switch tracked by the Arbitor in eir monthly
  report,  with valid values of “Narrow” (default) and “Wide.” A player may
  flip eir own Judge Status by announcement.

  When a CFJ has no judge assigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any player to be its
  judge by announcement, and SHALL do so within a week, but CANNOT do so if
  fewer than 2 days have passed since the CFJ was initiated. The players
  eligible to be assigned as judge are players except the initiator and the
  person barred (if any) who fulfill one of these requirements:

    1. Eir Judge Status is set to Narrow, and they have publicly declared
    Interest in the CFJ.

    2. Eir Judge Status is set to Wide, and they have not publicly declared
    Disinterest in the CFJ.

  The Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all interested players
  have reasonably equal opportunities to judge. If a CFJ has no judge assigned,
  then any player eligible to judge that CFJ CAN assign it to emself Without 3
  Objections.

  If there are no eligible judges for a CFJ for a period of 2 weeks, any player
  CAN judge it as DISMISS with 2 days Notice.
  }

For all players who have been assigned a CFJ within the past 2 weeks, flip their
Judge Status to Wide.
