I hereby distribute each listed proposal, initiating the Agoran
Decision of whether to adopt it, and removing it from the proposal
pool. For this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the
quorum is 7, the voting method is AI-majority, and the valid
options are FOR and AGAINST (PRESENT is also a valid vote, as are
conditional votes).

Title: Perfecting pledges (v1.2)
Adoption index: 1.7
Author: Jason Cobb
Co-authors: Falsifian


[Comment: This clarifies the wording to explicitly use both the time
window and penalty specified in the Oath. This also specifies that
pledges can only be violated once.]

Amend the first paragraph of Rule 2450 ("Pledges") to read:

  If a Player makes a clear public pledge (syn. Oath) to perform (or
  refrain from performing) certain actions, then breaking the pledge
  within the pledge's time window is the Class N crime of
  Oathbreaking. If the pledge specifically states that the pledge is
  under penalty of a Class A crime, where A is an integer not less
  than 1, then N is A; otherwise, N is 2. If the pledge specifically
  states that it operates only for a certain time window, and if that
  time window is prospective and not retrospective, then it operates
  only for that time window; otherwise, the pledge operates for 60
  days. It is impossible to commit the crime of Oathbreaking multiple
  times for a single pledge; breaking a single pledge multiple times
  constitutes a single crime.

Title: Sane AI Defaulting
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: G.


Amend Rule 1950 (Decisions with Adoption Indices) by replacing:
  Adoption index is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
  decisions and proposals, whose value is either "none" (default) or
  an integral multiple of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9.
with:
  Adoption index (AI) is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
  decisions and proposals.  For decisions, the possible values are
  "none" (default) or integral multiples of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9.
  For proposals, the possible values are integral multiples of 0.1
  from 1.0 to 9.9 (default 1.0).

Title: Just Make Them Write It Out
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris

[It's terribly confusing for everyone to leave out a proposal title. Leaving
out AI only works if it's 1.0 anyway, and confuses me every time I see it.
I usually spend like a solid minute checking that I haven't missed something
as Promotor and that the proposal is effective at that power as a player.
Just making these fields mandatory would save everyone so much trouble and
be only marginally more work for authors.]

Amend Rule 2350, "Proposals", by changing the first paragraph, including
the following list, to read in full:

  A proposal is an entity consisting of a body of text and
  other attributes. A player CAN create a proposal by announcement,
  specifying its text, an associated title, and a valid adoption index, and
  optionally specifying a list of co-authors (who must be persons other
  than the author).
