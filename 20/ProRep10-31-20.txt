{
  Except as otherwise specified by the rules, the owner of a stone CAN
  wield it by announcement specifying any values needed to interpret the
  stone's effects.

  If a stone has a frequency, then it is IMPOSSIBLE to wield that stone if
  it has been previously wielded in the same Agoran time interval as
  indicated by its frequency (e.g. if its frequency is daily, if it has
  been wielded in the same Agoran day).

  When a stone is wielded, the Rule defining that stone applies the
  effects in that stone's scroll.

  beginning of each Agoran month.

  A stone is immune if there has been no collection notice after it was
  most recently granted immunity (if ever), as defined by other rules.

  A collection notice includes, for every non-immune stone not belonging
  to Agora, a random choice of whether that stone escapes, escaping with
  probability equal to its escape risk. When a collection notice is
  published, stones that escape are transferred to Agora in an order
  specified by the collection notice.
}

{
  When a player makes a correct announcement that a single specified

  stones are transferred to Agora.
