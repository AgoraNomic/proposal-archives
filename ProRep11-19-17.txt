It's hereby enacted
(The name being redacted):

If a player should leave the game,
they will never be greeted with shame.
Instead a pillar of memory will be built in the sky,
it will last there forever,
it never shall die.
Tracked by whomever
tracks tracker-less things,
let's all watch the bountiful joy it brings
to see the names of those gone before
and the ways that they left, as they move into lore.

Title: Auctions v6
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: ATMunn
Co-authors: o, Aris, nichdel, G.

Create a power-2 rule titled "Auctions"
{
  An Auction is a way for entities to give away items in exchange for
  a currency. Any rule or contract CAN permit (or require) Auctions to be
  initiated.
}

Create a power-1 rule titled "Lots"
{
  Each Auction has one or more lots of items.

  A lot is a non-empty list of items to be transferred by a single Auction to
  a single recipient.
}

Create a power-1 rule titled "The Auctioneer"
{
  Each Auction has an Auctioneer.

  The Auctioneer of an Auction is the entity that initiates that
  Auction, and describes all of the specifics of an Auction. All
  rules or contracts permitting Auctions to be initiated should
  specify an entity to be Auctioneer. If no Auctioneer is specified,
  the default Auctioneer for Auctions defined by the rules is Agora, and
  the default Auctioneer for Auctions defined by a contract is the
  contract itself.

  A clause in a Contract purporting to make an entity which is neither the
  Contract itself nor a party to the Contract the Auctioneer of an Auction
  defined by that Contract is INEFFECTIVE.
}

Create a power-1 rule titled "The Auction Announcer"
{
  Each Auction has an Announcer. Only persons can be Announcers.

  If the Auctioneer of an Auction is a player, then that player is the
  Announcer of that Auction.

  Otherwise, the rule or contract defining an Auction CAN define the
  Announcer for that Auction. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no
  Contract can define a person as the Announcer of an Auction unless that
  person is a party to that Contract.
}

Create a power-1 rule titled "Auction Initiation"
{
  An entity authorized by a rule or contract to initiate an Auction CAN do so
  by announcement. If the rule or contract specifies that that entity MUST do
  so, that entity SHALL do so in a timely fashion. An Auction CANNOT be
  initiated other than as described by a rule or contract.

  An Auction CANNOT be initiated unless the announcer specifies all of

          * the Auction's lots, in the order they will be awarded,
          * the items in each lot,
          * the Auction's Auctioneer,
          * the Auction's Announcer,
          * the Auction's minimum bid, and, optionally
          * the Auction's currency

  in the message initiating the Auction. An Auction also CANNOT be initiated
  unless the Auctioneer is able to give away each item in each of the
  Auction's lots.

  If no currency is specified, it defaults to Shinies.
}

Create a power-1 rule titled "Bidding"
{
  A person authorized to bid on an Auction CAN do so by announcement,
  specifying the amount of the Auction's currency to bid. A bid placed on an
  Auction before it is initiated, or after it has ended, is INEFFECTIVE.

  An attempt to place a bid which is less than the Auction's minimum bid is
  INEFFECTIVE.

  A person CAN withdraw their bid on an Auction by announcement. If a person
  submits a bid on an Auction, all bids previously placed on that Auction by
  that person are withdrawn.

  A rule or contract defining an Auction CAN specify a class of players who
  are authorized to bid on that Auction. If the rule or contract does not
  specify a class of authorized bidders, any player is authorized to bid on
  an Auction defined by a rule, and any party to a contract is authorized to
  bid an Auction defined by that Contract.

  A person SHALL NOT bid on an Auction if it would be impossible for em to
  pay that amount at the conclusion of the Auction.
}

Create a power-1 rule titled "Auction End"
{
  An Auction ends 7 days after its initiation, or immediately if no bid has
  been placed or withdrawn in the last 96 hours, or immediately if it is
  terminated.

  When an Auction ends, any bid placed by an entity which does not own enough
  of the Auction's currency to pay the amount specified in the bid is
  automatically withdrawn.

  Once an Auction has ended, any further attempts to bid on that Auction or
  to withdraw bids from that Auction are INEFFECTIVE.

  Once the Auction has ended, the Auction's announcer SHALL announce
  the end of the Auction in a timely fashion. In the same message, e
  SHALL include the a list of all the bids on the Auction and the
  winner(s) (if there are any) of the Auction.

  A person's priority on an Auction is their position in the list of persons
  who have bid on the Auction, sorted by the value of their non-withdrawn
  bids in descending order. If two persons have placed non-withdrawn bids for
  the same value, a player who placed their non-withdrawn bid first has a
  higher priority than a player who placed their non-withdrawn bid at a later
  time.

  For each lot in the Auction, the winner of that lot is the player with the
  highest priority on the Auction who has not won any previous lot. If there
  are more lots than there are persons with non-withdrawn bids, the excess
  lots are not won by any person.

  The winner of a lot SHALL pay the Auctioneer the number of the Auction's
  currency equal to eir bid, in a single payment, in a timely fashion. When e
  does so, the Auctioneer SHALL transfer the items in that lot to that winner
  in a timely fashion. If the Auctioneer is not a person, then a person
  authorized to cause the Auctioneer to transfer those items SHALL do so in a
  timely fashion after the winner pays the Auctioneer, instead.
}

Create a power-1 rule titled "Auction Termination"
  {
  Any player CAN terminate an Auction, by announcement, if the Auction has
  not ended and the Auctioneer of that Auction cannot transfer any item
  included in a lot in that Auction.

  When an Auction is terminated, all bids on that Auction are withdrawn, and
  then the Auction ends immediately.
}

If it exists, amend rule 2491, "Estate Auctions" to read in full:
{
  At the start of each month, if Agora owns at least one Estate, then the
  Surveyor CAN and SHALL initiate an Estate Auction in a timely fashion.

  The Auctioneer of an Estate Auction is Agora. The Announcer of an Estate
  Auction is the Surveyor. The Starting Bid of an Estate Auction is 1 Shiny.

  An Estate Auction has one lot for each Estate owned by Agora, containing
  exactly and only that Estate. The Surveyor CAN freely determine the order
  in which those lots will be awarded.

  If an entity wins a lot in an Estate Auction, the Surveyor CAN, for each
  Estate in the lot, and at most once per Estate per Estate Auction, cause
  Agora to transfer each Estate to that entity.

Title:  A Mostest Ingenious Paradox
Adoption index: 1.7
Author: Alexis
Co-authors: ais523


Text in square brackets is not a part of this proposal and has no
effect.

Enact a new power-1 rule entitled "Win by Paradox":

  If a CFJ about the legality or possibility of a game action, has been
  assigned a judgment of PARADOXICAL continuously
  for at least 7 days, and e has not done so already in respect of
  that CFJ, then that case's initiator CAN, by announcement, win the
  game.

  A player who wins in this fashion SHOULD submit a proposal to
  prevent the paradox from arising again.

Amend rule 591 by replacing:

  The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
  the truth or falsity of the statement at the time the inquiry case
  was initiated (if its truth value changed at that time, then its
  initial truth value is used):

with:

  The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
  the facts and legal situation at the time the inquiry case was
  initiated, not taking into account any events since that time:

[This is to prevent changing facts not related to truth or falsity, e.g.
availability of information, from affecting outcomes.]

and by replacing:

  * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
    if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
    reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
    answered with another valid judgement.

with:

  * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
    if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
    reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
    answered with another valid judgement. DISMISS is not
    appropriate if PARADOXICAL is appropriate.

and by appending to the end:

  * PARADOXICAL, appropriate if the statement is logically
    undecidable as a result of a paradox or or other irresovable
    logical situation. PARADOXICAL is not appropriate if IRRELEVANT
    is appropriate, nor is it appropriate if the undecidability
    arises from the case itself or in reference to it.

[The reference to IRRELEVANT is to prevent multiple wins from the same
paradox.]

  syn. Judicial Case) by announcement, specifying a statement to be

Amend rule 2445 (How to Pend a Proposal) by replacing the second

       other than for sustenance (e.g. by authorizing parties to
       spend the contract's assets), then the contract is willing to
       receive all assets.

    2. Otherwise, it is unwilling to receive all assets.

  The previous paragraph (including the list) notwithstanding, a
  contract CAN be given 1 shiny a month for its sustenance payment,
  so long as it never has more than 1 shiny at a time.

Amend Rule 2516 (Passive Income) to read:

  The Treasuror CAN, once each month, and SHALL, in a timely fashion
  after the start of each month, publish a Payday Notice. The effect
  of such a Notice is to:

     1. Destroy all Shinies in Agora's possession.

     2. Create 25 Shinies in the possession of each player.

     3. For each office, if a single player held that office for
        16 or more days in the previous month and did not receive
        a card other than Green during that time for performance or
        nonperformance of that office's duties, create 10 shinies
        in the possession of that player.


Amend Rule 2497 (Floating Value) to read:

  Floating Value is a natural singleton switch, tracked by the
  Treasuror.

  The Treasuror CAN, once each month, and SHALL, in a timely
  fashion after the start of each month, publish a valid Notice
  of Agoran Productivity, containing eir best estimate of the
  total number of shinies that were in Agora's possession at
  the end of the previous month.  The Notice is invalid if the
  estimate differs from the correct value by more than 10%, and
  the error is publicly identified within one week of its
  publication.

  The effect of a valid Notice of Agoran Productivity is to flip
  the Floating Value to the announced estimate.

  The following Floating Derived Values are defined:

  * Stamp Value: 1/5th of the Floating Value, rounded up.

  * Pend Cost: 1/10th of the Floating Value, rounded up.

  * CFJ Cost: 1/20th of the Floating Value, rounded up.

  The Treasuror's weekly report includes all floating-derived
  values defined by the Rules.


Amend Rule 2498 (Economic Wins) by replacing:
  If Agora owns at least as many Shinies as the current Stamp Value,
  a player CAN, by announcement, destroy a Stamp e owns to cause
  Agora to transfer the Stamp Value, in shinies, to emself.
with:
  A player CAN, by announcement, destroy a Stamp e owns to create,
  in eir possession, a number of shinies equal the Stamp Value.
  If the Stamp's creator was not the destroying player, half
  the Stamp value (rounded up) in shinies are created in the
  possession of the Stamp's creator.

[Encourages stamp trading!!]


Amend Rule 2499 (Welcome Packages) by replacing:
  Agora transfers 50 shinies to em.
with:
  25 shinies are created in eir possession.


Amend Rule 2483 (Economics) by replacing:
  The Treasuror is the recordkeepor for shinies.

  a) spending 1 Action Point, OR

  b) spending the current Pend Cost in shinies.
with:
  a) spending the current Pend Cost in shinies, OR

  b) Without 2 Objections.  Players SHOULD object unless the
     proposal consists entirely of bug fixes or minor
     playability adjustments for the good of the game overall.


Amend Rule 991 (Calls for Judgement) by replacing:
  a) by announcement, and spending 1 Action Point, OR

  b) by announcement, and spending the current CFJ cost in shinies,

     with shinies is a significant barrier to the Caller's
     ability to seek a resolution to the controversy.


Amend Rule 2496 (Rewards) to read in full:
  A Reward is a specified amount of a currency associated with a
  Reward Condition. For each time a player meets a Reward Condition,
  e CAN claim the specified award, by announcement, exactly once
  within 24 hours of meeting the Reward Condition.  When a player
  'claims' a Reward, Agora transfers the specified amount of that
  currency to the player, if Agora possesses sufficient currency to
  do so.

[The basic definition of "reward" is useful in general so we keep it].
