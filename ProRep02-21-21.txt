  other player CAN once grant em X boatloads of coins by announcement,
  where X is 3 if it is actually the day of the player's birthday, and 2

invalidate the current method of simply publishing a report with the
relevant information.]

Amend Rule 2141, "Role and Attributes of Rules", by replacing:

  Every rule shall have an ID number, distinct among current and
  former rules, to be assigned once by the Rulekeepor.

Adoption index: 2.0


Amend Rule 2643 "Collecting Stones" by replacing the final paragraph
with the following:
{

  A collection notice includes zero or more random choices of whether each
  stone escapes. Each choice results in escape with probability equal to
  its escape risk; a stone escapes if any choice selects escape. When a
  collection notice is published, stones that escape are transferred to
  Agora in an order specified by the collection notice.

  If a stone is immune, there are zero escape choices; otherwise, there is
  one choice if the stone was used in the previous Agoran month, or two if
  it was not.

Title: Clarify dependent actions
Author: Murphy

Adoption index: 3.0


Amend Rule 2595 (Performing a Dependent Action) to read:

   A rule that purports to allow a person (the performer) to perform
   an action by a set of one or more dependent actions thereby allows
   em to perform the action by announcement if all of the following
   are true:

   1. A person (the initiator) published an announcement of intent
      that unambiguously, clearly, conspicuously, and without
      obfuscation specified the action intended to be taken and the
      method(s) to be used, including these values if relevant:

        * If the action is to be taken with T notice, then the value
          of T.

        * If the action is to be taken without N objections, with N
          support, or with N Agoran Consent, and N is not equal to 1,
          then the value of N.

   2. The time between the announcement of intent and the action is
      at most 14 days. In addition:

        * If the action is to be taken without N objections or with N
          Agoran consent, then it is at least 4 days.

        * If the action is to be taken with T notice, then it is at
          least T (minimum of 4 days).

   3. At least one of the following is true:

        * The performer is the initiator.

        * The initiator was authorized to perform the action due to
          holding a rule-defined position now held by the performer.

        * The initiator is authorized to perform the action, the
          action depends on support, the performer has supported the
          intent, and the rule authorizing the performance does not
          explicitly prohibit supporters from performing it.

   4. Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by
      other Rules.

   5. If the announcement of intent stated any conditions, then those
      conditions are all met.

   If the action is to be taken with N Agoran consent, then the
   performer SHOULD publish a list of supporters and objectors.

Amend Rule 2124 (Agoran Satisfaction) to read:

  A Supporter of an intent to perform an action is an eligible
  entity who has publicly posted (and not withdrawn) support for an
  announcement of that intent.

  An Objector to an intent to perform an action is an eligible
  entity who has publicly posted (and not withdrawn) an objection to
  the announcement of that intent.

  The entities eligible to support or object to an intent to perform
  an action are, by default, all players, subject to modification by
  the document authorizing the dependent action. However, the
  previous sentence notwithstanding, the initiator of the intent is
  not eligible to support it, and a person CANNOT support or object
  to an announcement of intent before the intent is announced, or
  after e has withdrawn the same type of response.

  Agora is Satisfied with an intent to perform a specific action
  unless at least one of the following is true:

  1. The action is to be performed without N objections, and there
    are at least N Objectors to that intent.

  2. The action is to be performed with N support, and there are
    fewer than than N Supporters of that intent.

  3. The action is to be performed with N Agoran consent, and the
    number of Supporters of that intent is less than or equal to N
    times the number of Objectors to that intent.

  4. The action is to be performed without N objections or with N
    Agora consent, and an objection to that intent was withdrawn
    within the past 24 hours.

  5. The Speaker objected to that intent within the past 48 hours.
