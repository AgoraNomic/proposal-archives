Title: No Honour
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: nix
Co-authors: Jason


Repeal R2510, "Such is Karma".

[Karma gets rare, sporadic usage and I'd prefer not to maintain it if
it's not going to be used. I'm also open to supporting efforts to revive
it, but I don't have the time/interest to write such proposals myself
right now.]

Title: Patent Title Restoration v2
Adoption index: 1.5
Author: Jason
Co-author(s):


Amend Rule 649 by replacing "A Patent Title is a legal title given to a
person in recognition of the person's distinction" with "A Patent Title
is a legal title held by an entity in recognition of eir distinction".

[The current version could plausibly be read to strip patent titles when
an entity ceases to be a person. This makes it so that patent titles can
be held by all entities, but can only be awarded to persons. The
requirement on personhood/citizenship is explicit for most awarding
methods (including the Herald's general method), while the other methods
require 2 Agoran consent, which should be enough to prevent them going
to non-persons if we don't want them to as a group. There's not really
an easy place to put an explicit restriction, because some of the 2
Agoran consent methods are at Power 3, while the patent titles rule is
at Power 1.5.]

Award all Patent Titles to eir former holders that were lost solely due
to the entity not being a person (under any current or former definition
of "person"), other than Hero of Agora Nomic or Grand Hero of Agora Nomic.

[Don't try to award HAN/GHAN because it seems unlikely they were ever
stripped and because this proposal doesn't have high enough AI to do so.]

Title: Personhood Revisited
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: nix
Co-author(s): Gaelan, Aris


Amend R869 by replacing:

  Any entity that is or ever was an organism generally capable of
  freely originating and communicating independent thoughts and
  ideas is a person. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no other
  entities are persons.

with:

  Every intelligence is a person. A group of persons can elect to
  create a composite person, which is in eirself a person for all
  Agoran purposes. A person cannot become a player if e is part of a
  composite person that is already a player. A composite person
  cannot become a player if any part of em is already a player. A
  person does not ever cease to be a person for the purposes of
  Agora.

[This reworks and combines versions put forth by both Aris and Gaelan.]

Title: Extension to Blot Expungement Definitions
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: JTAC
Co-author(s): Jason, G.


Amend Rule 2555 by adding "If expungement would destroy N blots, but the
target has P<N blots, then the expungement instead destroys P blots. If
P=0, the action attempts to destroy no blots." between the second and
third paragraphs.

Amend Rule 2555 again by adding "The above paragraph notwithstanding, if
an expungement attempts to destroy no blots, a player does not pay any
Blot-B-Gones to perform this action." between the second last and last
paragraph.

[Clarifies an edge case where a person tries to apologize after
expunging a blot. Improves on Jason's withdrawn proposal by improving
scope of redefinition.

Adapts G.'s draft rule to a form which should prevent contradiction with
rule 2577 using any reasonable interpretation, as well as circumvents
the weirdness with Blot-B-Gones by preventing rule 2579 from taking
effect when P=0.]
