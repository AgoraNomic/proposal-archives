Title: Close Ancient Loopholes
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: ais523
Co-author(s):


Amend rule 879 so that it has the following text:
{{{
    Each Agoran Decision has a quorum. This is a number set when the
    decision is created, and thereafter cannot be changed. When a
    person initiates an Agoran Decision, that person SHALL state the
    quorum of that decision. However, incorrectly stating the quorum
    of a decision does not invalidate the initiation, nor does it
    actually change the quorum of the decision.

    The quorum that an Agoran Decision gains as it is created can be
    defined by other rules of power 2 or greater. If no other rule
    defines the quorum of an Agoran Decision, the quorum for that
    decision is equal to the number of players who voted on the
    Agoran Decision to adopt a proposal that had been most recently
    resolved at the time of that decision's initiation, minus 2.

    As an exception to the previous paragraph, the quorum of an
    Agoran Decision can never be less than 2. If the rules would
    attempt to set the quorum of an Agoran Decision to less than 2,
    it is set to 2 instead.
}}}

Amend rule 955 by replacing the text:
{{{
      - If there is more than one option, and the number of valid
        ballots is less than quorum, the outcome is instead FAILED
        QUORUM.
}}}
with:
{{{
      - If there is more than one option, and the number of valid
        ballots is less than the quorum of that decision, the outcome
        is instead FAILED QUORUM.

Amend rule 683, by replacing the last paragraph with:
{{{
      A valid ballot is a ballot, correctly submitted, that has not
      been withdrawn. During the voting period of an Agoran decision,
      a player CAN by announcement withdraw (syn. retract) a ballot
      that e submitted on that decision. To "change" one's vote is to
      retract eir previous ballot (if any), then submit a new one.
}}}

Amend rule 2445 so that it has the following text:
{{{
      Imminence is a switch, tracked by the Promotor, possessed by
      proposals in the Proposal Pool, whose value is either "pending"
      or "not pending" (default).

      Pending List Price is an integer switch, tracked by the Promotor,
      whose default value is 5. At the beginning of every month, the
      Pending List Price is set to 90% of the mean of the price paid
      for each proposal pended in the previous month, rounded down. If
      less than 2 proposals were pended in the previous month, the
      Pending List Price is set to its default.

      Any player CAN pay Agora a specified amount, which is no less
      than the Pending List Price, to flip a proposal's imminence
      to "pending" by announcement. If the specified amount is less
      than the Pending List Price, then the attempt to pay is
      INEFFECTIVE, and the proposal's imminence is not flipped.
}}}

Amend the rule created during the resolution of proposal 7850 by
deleting all paragraphs that contain the word "imminence", and then
inserting the following paragraphs at the end:
{{{
      ais523 CAN cause a specified player to earn a Black Ribbon by
      announcement.

      ais523 CAN cause this rule to repeal itself by announcement.
}}}
[I already have my Black Ribbon, so I forgot that I might potentially
need to award them to co-conspirators. Also, give me a way to clean up
the rule when I'm done giving out rewards. As a reminder to people who
aren't used to the Ribbon system, the idea of Black Ribbons is that
they can only be gained via proposal or via scam, and it's standard to
give a Black Ribbon to all the participants in a scam if it's capable
of altering the gamestate enough to give Ribbons.]

Then retitle that rule to "Scam Reward".

  Change Rule 1367 to read in full:

    Certain patent titles are known as degrees.  The degrees are

    - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
    - Bachelor of Nomic                  (B.N.)
    - Master of Nomic                    (M.N.)
    - Doctor of Nomic History            (D.N.Hist.)
    - Doctor of Nomic Science            (D.N.Sci.)
    - Doctor of Nomic Philosophy         (D.N.Phil.)

    Degrees are ranked in the order they appear in this rule, with degrees
    listed later being ranked higher.  A specific degree CANNOT be awarded
    to any person more than once.

    A specified degree CAN be awarded with 2 Agoran Consent, and SHOULD
    only be awarded for the publication of an original thesis of scholarly
    worth (including responses to peer-review), published with explicit
    intent to qualify for a degree. Persons wanting a degree MUST request
    a mentor from the Herald before having made substantial progress on
    eir thesis. The Herald SHOULD coordinate the finding of a mentor for
    any person requesting one. The mentor SHOULD answer questions of the
    mentee and assist in the writing of eir thesis. The mentor SHOULD
    coordinate the peer-review process for the thesis.

Title: Pending List Price Adjustment
Adoption Index: 1.0
Author: nichdel
Co-author(s):

  Amend Rule 2445 by replacing the second, thirdand fourth paragraphs with:

        Pending List Price is an integer switch, tracked by the Promotor,
        whose default value is 5. At the beginning of every month, the
        Pending List Price is set to nine-tenths of the mean of the price
        paid for each proposal pended in the previous month, rounded
        down. If less than 2 proposals were pended in the previous month,
        the Pending List Price is set to its default.

        Any player CAN pay Agora a specified amount, which is no less
        than the Pending List Price, to flip a proposal's imminence to
        "pending" by announcement. If the specified amount is less than
        the Pending List Price, then the attempt to pay is  INEFFECTIVE,
        and the proposal's imminence is not flipped.

  [Basically just combines Pending Minimum and Pending List. The simpler
  math also means that the price tends to end up a tiny bit higher than
  the previous scheme.]

complete an item on the to-do list and claim the specified number of Shinies
associated with it by notifying the Lister of their completion of the task. If
the Lister agrees with the claimee, the Lister shall without two objection pay
the claimee the specified number of Shinies from Agora. Any disagreement
regarding completion shall be resolved via a CFJ. After an item has been
completed, the Lister shall remove it from the to-do list."

Enact a rule titled, "The Office of the Lister", reading: "The Lister

Enact a new rule entitled "Reader's Digest": {
  There exists an elected office called Digestive System. "Digestibility" is a
  singleton switch tracked by the Digestive System with possible values
  "MONTHLY" and "WEEKLY"; the Digestive System can flip this by announcement.

  The Digestive System SHALL regularly issue a report which accurately
  summarizes the state and activities of Agoranomic throughout the relevant
  period. This report need not be comprehensive, but will contain that
  information, as assessed by the Digestive System, which would be of the
  greatest relevance or importance for a player who had been inattentive to the
  state of the nomic during the relevant period. If Digestibility is MONTHLY,
  the relevant period is the preceding month; if it is WEEKLY, it is the
  preceding week.
