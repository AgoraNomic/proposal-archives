[A few comments:
  1. I probably got something wrong. If I did, I'm sorry. It would be nice if
  people could point my errors out, and help fix them (not object to RWOs,
  etc.).
  2. I had a lot to do this week, and a few things people did made it more
  complicated than it had to be. Creating a bunch of new proposals in a rush on
  Sunday afternoon right before the end of the week really isn't helpful. I
  would also appreciate it if people could mark their proposals with
  "[Proposal]", or "Proposal:" or something along those lines. Thanks to the
  people who did that.
]

I hereby distribute each listed proposal, initiating the Agoran
Decision of whether to adopt it, and removing it from the proposal
pool. For this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the
quorum is 3.0 and the valid options are FOR and AGAINST (PRESENT is
also a valid vote).

[v. 2.1 change: fixed the list numbering]

Enact the following Rule, "Random Choices", Power-1:
  When a Rule specifies that a random choice be made, then the choice shall be
  made using whatever probability distribution among the possible outcomes the
  Rule specifies, defaulting to a uniform probability distribution.

  The choice CAN be made using any physical or computational process whose
  probability distribution among the possible outcomes is reasonably close to
  that required by the Rules, and for which the final choice is not trivially
  predictable by the selecting person in advance.  The selecting person SHOULD
  make the selection method public, and SHOULD use a method for which
  the final probability distribution can be readily confirmed.

[Note:  "confirming the distribution" includes "confirming that the
selector didn't just keep re-rolling until e got the desired result",
(because that changes the final distribution for the whole process to
be 100% whatever the selector was aiming for).  The "trivially" in
"trivially predictable" means you can use a PRNG, which is technically
deterministic, but only "trivially" predictable if you run it with
a set seed in advance.  "Reasonably close" is to not get hung up on
machine rounding, but also means we don't undo things if a calculation
is *slightly* off (with *slightly* to be determined by judges etc.).
Keeping it SHOULD instead of SHALL because I prefer to let the Officer
have a little latitude.  These are hard-earned lessons from the days
when we dealt cards from a deck, and kept having to reset the whole
deck because a single card had been missing from the draw].


Amend Rule 2445 (How to Pend a Proposal) by appending the following
paragraph:
  An Official Proposal is a proposal designated as such by the Rules; generally
  official proposals that are created as part of an Officer's duties. Rules to
  the contrary notwithstanding, an Official proposal is always pending. Rules
  to the contrary notwithstanding, players CANNOT claim rewards for the adoption
  of an Official proposal.


Re-enact Rule 2309 (The Propose-O-Matic), with the following text:

  The Fearmongor is an Office. Its holder is responsible for
  ensuring the continuous change of the ruleset.

  Each month, the Fearmongor SHALL do the following as part of
  eir duties:

    1) Select two existing rules at random. For each of those
       rules, submit an Official proposal with AI equal to that
       rules' power. One proposal SHALL specify only to repeal
       its rule; the other SHALL specify only to amend its rule.

    2) Select a previous rule that was repealed over 1 year
       ago, and has not been so selected in the past 6 months.
       Submit an Official proposal of the appropriate AI to
       re-enact the rule at its previous power, using any
       past version of the rule as a basis and making minimal
       modifications to that text to allow the rule to function
       in the current ruleset.

  conclude the investigation by:

   - issuing a Card to the pointed-at person by announcement whose
     reason is rooted in the allegation; or

   - if e believes that no rules violation occurred or that it
     would be ILLEGAL to issue a Card for it, announcing the
     Finger Pointing to be Shenanigans.

  The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
  Pointing.  When a Finger, other than the Arbitor's, is Pointed
  over an allegation related to the official duties or powers of
  the Referee, then the Arbitor CAN, by announcement, take over
  the investigation and thereby become the investigator.

  A player CANNOT point a finger more than twice per Agoran week,

  believes that there are no rules violations in the preceding
  Agoran week for which a Card has not already been issued.


Amend Rule 2474, "Green Cards", to read in full:

  A Green Card is a type of Card that is appropriate for minor, accidental,
  and/or inconsequential infraction. A Green Card is also appropriate for any
  infraction for which no other type of Card is appropriate. 'Tis appropriate to
  issue a Green Card to a non-player person who plays the game, for the
  infractions previously described. When a person is issued a Green Card, e
  is ENCOURAGED to travel to the United States.


Create a power 2.0 rule entitled "Blue Cards", with the following text:

  A Blue Card is a type of Card that is appropriate for deliberate or negligent
  infractions either where the the player responsible profited from violating
  the rules or where e significantly harmed another person or the game
  as a whole. The person issuing a Blue Card must, in the same message,
  announce a penalty between 1 shiny and the greater of 25 shinies and the
  amount the bad sport profited from the infraction, in order for the card to
  be effective. E CAN additionally, in the same message, determine the
  distribution of the money between Agora and the players(s) harmed, save
  that e CANNOT distribute money to emself or such that it would be under
  eir effective control. By default, all the money goes to Agora.

  When a Blue Card is issued, as a penalty, within the next 7 days, any player
  CAN once, with 2 Support, Levy a Fine upon the bad sport. After the Fine is
  Levied upon the bad sport, e SHALL endeavor in good faith to pay the fine
  to Agora or the correct player(s), in accordance with the distribution laid

  currently a player, who either broke the rules while not a player or
  broke them while a player and then deregistered in bad faith. A Black

  of these limitations is INEFFECTIVE.

  When a Black Card is issued, as a penalty, within the next 7 days, any player
  CAN once, with Agoran Consent, Slam the Door at the bad sport. After the Door
  is Slammed at a person, e CANNOT register or take any game actions for 30
  days, rules to the contrary notwithstanding. Any attempt to Slam the Door on
  a player or a person whose most recent deregistration took place without
  eir consent is INEFFECTIVE, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

Author: o

This proposal is dedicated to William Darrel Mays.

[For help finding paragraph boundaries, see CFJ 3452. This proposal
body MUST be interpreted, generally, to assume that lists are part
of the surrounding paragraph, or one of the adjacent paragraphs.]

Amend rule 105 ("Rule Changes") by replacing item 3 of the first
list with:

  {{{
     3. reenact a rule. A repealed rule identified by its most
     recent rule number MUST be reenacted with the same ID number and
     the next change identifier. If no text is specified, the rule
     is reenacted with the same text it had when it was most
     recently repealed. If the reenacting proposal provides new text
     for the rule, the rule must have materially the same purpose as
     did the repealed version; otherwise, the attempt to reenact the
     rule is null and void.
  }}}

[Changes a "may" to a "MUST", since reenactment is otherwise
governed by the rules governing instruments.]

Amend rule 2493 ("Regulations") by replacing the fourth paragraph
with:

  {{{
     A regulation (or set of regulations), authorized by another
     rule, CAN generally be enacted or modified by its promulgator
     without 2 objections, or with Agoran consent. A notice pursuant
     to the previous sentence is known as a "recommendation", and
     the regulation(s) are said to be "recommended" to Agora.
  }}}

Amend rule 991 ("Calls for Judgement") by replacing the second
paragraph, which begins "When a person initiates", with:

  {{{
     When a person initiates a Call for Judgment, e CAN optionally
     bar one person from the case by announcement.
  }}}

Amend rule 2492 ("Recusal") by replacing the first paragraph with:

  {{{
     A judge CAN recuse emself from a CFJ they are assigned to by
     announcement.
  }}}

Amend rule 2231 ("Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic") to read, in
full:

  {{{
     Heroic titles are Agora's premier patent titles of distinction,
     and CAN be awarded to persons for meritorious service only by a
     proposal of power 3 or greater, which SHOULD explain why those
     persons are qualified. Bearers of heroic titles (Heroes)
     constitute the Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic.

     The Heroic titles in decreasing precedence are:

     Grand Hero of Agora Nomic (GHAN) -- This title CAN be awarded
     to any person obviously and directly responsible for the
     existence of Agora and/or Nomic in general. As this title is
     the highest honour that Agora may bestow, a Bearer of this
     title OUGHT to be treated right good forever.

     Hero of Agora Nomic (HAN) -- This title CAN be awarded to any
     person for outstanding meritorious service to Agora above and
     beyond the call of duty.
  }}}

Amend rule 2467 ("Agencies") by replacing the first paragraph with:

  {{{
     An Agency is a document empowering persons to act on behalf of
     another player. A player CAN establish an Agency With 24 hours
     Notice, and thereby become its Director, by specifying the
     properties of the new Agency, provided e has not established
     any other Agency that day:

     1. A title, which must be exactly three words, not counting
     conjunctions, articles or prepositions.

     2. A non-empty list of persons other than the Director (the
     Agents).

     3. A description of a set of actions (the Powers).

  {{{
     The Agents of an Agency CAN perform the Actions described in
     the Powers of the Agency on behalf of the Agency's Director, in
     the same manner by which the Agency's Director can perform
     those Actions.
  }}}

  Amend rule 2464 ("Tournaments") by replacing its text, in full,
  with:

  {{{
     A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned to
     be initiated as a tournament by the Rules. If a winner of a
     tournament is determined within 4 weeks of its initiation, that
     person or persons win the game, otherwise the tournament
     concludes with no winner. A Tournament is governed by a special
     temporary title of the ACORN, created in accordance with its
     parent rule, which have binding control over those who freely
     agree to play the tournament and over the tournament itself.
     Once the tournament is concluded, these regulations cease to
     have any effect, and CAN be repealed by any player by
     announcement.
  }}}

  Amend rule 2491 ("Estate Auctions") to read, in full:

  {{{
     At the start of each month, if Agora owns at least one Estate,
     the Surveyor CAN, by announcement, and SHALL in a timely
     fashion, put one Estate which is owned by Agora up for auction.
     Each auction ends seven days after it begins.

     During an auction, any player CAN bid a number of Shinies on
     eir own behalf, by announcement, or on behalf of any
     Organization for which such a bid is Appropriate, by
     announcement, provided the bid is higher than any
     previously-placed bid in the same auction.

     If, at the end of the auction, there is a single highest bid,
     then that player or Organization wins the auction. The player
     who placed the winning bid CAN, and SHALL in a timely fashion,
     cause Agora to transfer the auctioned Estate to the winner by
     announcement, by paying Agora the amount of the bid, or by
     causing the winning Organization to pay Agora the amount of the
     bid.

[This is more extensive than Estate Auction Cleanup but covers all
defects fixed in that proposal.]

Amend rule 2496 ("Rewards") by replacing the first paragraph with:

  {{{

[This probably worked by accident, but it's worth clarifying.]

Amend rule 2480 ("Festivals") by replacing the second and third
paragraphs with:

{{{
   If Agora's Festivity has had the same nonzero value for 14 days
   or more, any player CAN flip it to 0 by announcement.

   A player who owns at least N types of Ribbon CAN Start a Rank N
   Festival, where N is an integer greater than Agora's Festivity,
   with 4 Support from players who own at least N types of Ribbon.
   Upon doing so, Agora's Festivity is flipped to N. Exception: A
   player CANNOT do so if Agora's Festivity has had a value
   greater than or equal to N within the past 21 days.

[Note to the Assessor: please resolve after "Float On".]

[It is my belief that the current floating value problem was primarily caused
by the Secretary only being able to set the floating value correctly. This
erases certainty, as any flaw in the Secretary's report likely invalidates all
rule-defined transactions until the flaw is discovered unless the switch
self-ratifies. The probability of deliberate abuse by the secretary is small,
the probability of error is large.]

If the proposal "Float On" been adopted: {
Amend Rule 2497, "Floating Value", by changing its first paragraph to read:

  Floating Value is a natural singleton switch, tracked by the Secretary.

Amend Rule 2456, "The Secretary", by changing the paragraph "As part of the
Secretary's weekly duties, e CAN and SHALL flip the Floating Value to the
number of Shinies owned by Agora. E SHOULD do this while publishing eir
weekly report." to read as follows:

  The Secretary CAN flip the floating value once a week by announcement. As part
  of eir weekly duties, e SHALL flip the Floating Value to the number of Shinies
  owned by Agora; e SHALL NOT ever set it to a different value.
  E SHOULD do this while publishing eir weekly report. If the Secretary
  discovers that e last flipped the floating value to an incorrect value and e
  would not otherwise be able to set it again yet, e CAN and SHALL set the value
  to what it should have been set to in the first place by announcement.

} Otherwise, if the proposal "Float On" has been resolved, but not adopted: {
Amend Rule 2497, "Floating Value", by changing it to read in full:

  Floating Value is a natural singleton switch, tracked by the Secretary.

  The Secretary CAN flip the floating value once a week by announcement. As part

Create a Power 1 rule titled “The Hot Potato” (or amend it, if it already
exists) with the following text: {{

  For the purposes of this rule, the Wealth of a player may be calculated
  by taking their shiny balance, then, for each organization they are a member
  of, adding the shiny balance of that organization divided by that
  organization’s member count, rounded down.

  The player with the largest Wealth value is said to have the Hot Potato.

  Combustibility is defined as (x/500)*(y/30) where x is the difference between
  the lowest and highest player Wealth values, and y is the number of days in
  the past 30 days in which the current holder of the Hot Potato has held the
  Hot Potato at any point in the day. If Combustibility would be greater than 1
  according to the above formula, it is instead defined as 1.

  The Pyromaniac is an office.

  Once per day, the Pyromaniac SHALL randomly select whether or not Combustion
  occurs, such that the probability of Combustion occurring is equal to the
  current Combustibility. If Combustion occurs, the Pyromaniac SHALL announce
  this publicly. The Pyromaniac NEED NOT announce that Combustion has not
  occurred. When Combustion occurs, half of the current Hot Potato holder’s
  shinies are evenly distributed among the remaining players, with players with
  lower wealth receiving more shinies if even division is not possible. Then,
  for each organization the Combusted player is a member of, a portion of the
  organization’s shiny balance, calculated via the formula 1/(2x) where x is the
  number of members, is evenly distributed among all players, breaking ties with
  players with lower wealth receiving more shinies if even division is not
  possible.

  If the rules define a concept known a as a Contract, any player may cause this
  rule to amend itself by announcement, replacing the word “organization” with
  “contract” and “member” with “party,” then removing this paragraph. If the
  current date is after November 2017, any player may cause this rule to amend
  itself by removing this paragraph.

Amend Rule 2471, "No Faking", by changing it to read in full:

  A person SHALL NOT make a public statement that is a lie. A statment is a lie
  if its publisher either knew or believed it to be not to be true at the time
  e published it (or, in the case of an action, not to be effective), and it
  was made with the intent to mislead. Merely quoting a statement does not
  constitute making it for the purposes of this rule.  Any disclaimer,
  conditional clause, or other qualifier attached to a statement constitutes
  part of the statement for the purposes of this rule; the truth or falsity of
  the whole is what is significant.

  The previous provisions of this rule notwithstanding, a formal announcement of
  intent is never a lie.

Amend Rule 2487 (Shiny Supply Level) to read:

  Supply Level is a singleton natural switch tracked by the
  Secretary, with a default value of 1000.

  When a Shiny Releveling event occurs, Agora's Balance is
  increased or decreased such that all Balances add up to the
  Supply Level.  When the Supply Level Changes, a Shiny Releveling
  event occurs.  The Secretary CAN cause a Shiny Releveling event
  to occur without 3 Objections.

  In a timely fashion after the start of each month, the Secretary
  CAN and SHALL Determine the Weather by announcement, by selecting
  and announcing an option from among the following choices, using
  the indicated probabilities:
    Same (50%), Improving (25%), Deteriorating (25%).

  Determining the weather to be Improving sets the Supply Level
  25% higher (rounded down).  Determining the Supply Level to
  be Deteriorating sets the Supply Level 25% lower (rounded up).

The Supply Level switch is hereby set to the value of the Supply Level
