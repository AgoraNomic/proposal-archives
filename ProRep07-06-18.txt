I hereby distribute each listed proposal, initiating the Agoran
Decision of whether to adopt it, and removing it from the proposal
pool. For this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the
quorum is 5.0 [1], the voting method is AI-majority and the valid
options are FOR and AGAINST (PRESENT is also a valid vote, as are
conditional votes).

[1] Quorum is provisional, and could actually be anywhere between
5.0 and 7.0.

Title: Separation of church and state
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: twg
Co-authors: Trigon


[ The blots amendment is lifted verbatim from Trigon's version of the repeal,
  so I listed em as a co-author. ]

Amend rule 2559, "Paydays", by removing the list item "3 incense".

Destroy all temples.

Amend rule 2563, "Production Facilities", by removing the list item "Temples"
and all bullet points subordinate to it.

Destroy all incense.

Amend rule 2483, "Economics", by removing incense from the list of currencies
and from the list of unrefinable currencies.

Amend rule 2555, "Blots", by adding the following paragraphs:

  If a player has neither gained blots nor expunged any blots from
  emself in the current Agoran week, e CAN expunge 1 blot from
  emself by announcement.

  At the beginning of each quarter, half (rounded down) of each
  fugitive's blots are destroyed.

Amend rule 2564, "Processing Facilities", to read in full:

  The following facilities are defined as processing facilities:
    1. Refineries
       -  Build Cost: 4 lumber and 8 stones
       -  Upkeep Cost: 3 coins
       -  Processing Details: 1 ore to 5 coins

    2. Mills
       -  Build Cost: 6 lumber and 6 stones
       -  Upkeep Cost: 3 coins
       -  Processing Details: 1 lumber to 5 paper

    3. Looms
       - Build Cost: 8 lumber and 4 stones
       - Upkeep Cost: 3 coins
       - Processing Details: 1 cotton to 5 fabric

Flip the ranks of all processing facilities to their default values.

[ That last sentence relieves the Cartographor of keeping track of the legacy
  ranks that don't mean anything any more. ]

Title: Back to one auction
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: twg
Co-authors:


Amend rule 2004, "Land Auctions", by replacing the first sentence of the last
paragraph with the following:

  If at least one land unit is selected by the process described above,
  the Cartographor CAN and SHALL initiate an auction with each selected
  land unit as a lot. The authorized bidders for this auction are all
  active players.

[ Note that, unlike the original version, zombies are banned from bidding. ]

Title: Frankenstein's land auctions
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: twg
Co-authors:


[ Here's another option: specific land auction rules that are a hybrid of one
  and five auctions. Pick your favourite? ]

Amend rule 2004, "Land Auctions", by replacing the last sentence with the
following:

  For this auction, the announcer is the Cartographor, the auctioneer
  is Agora, the minimum bid is 1 coin, and the authorized bidders
  are all active players.

[ The above bans zombies from bidding. ]

Amend rule 2004, "Land Auctions", by appending the following as a new
paragraph:

  When a land auction ends, all bids by the winner of that auction on
  other land auctions are withdrawn.

[ The phrasing here is based on the assumption that auctions started in the
  same message end one at a time rather than simultaneously, which I think I
  remember reading a CFJ about. The idea is that people can choose which units
  of land they are interested in (which is the principal advantage of the five-
  auction method) but can't dominate the market and win all the auctions. ]

Title: Crackdown on minting (reindustrialisation edition)
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: twg

[ As I've said before, I think coin production needs to go altogether, but
  destroying the refineries outright seems unnecessarily unfair, so my
  preference is for this edition - though I haven't come up with anything to
  use steel for yet. Also, G., I apologise for my appalling timing in proposing
  to render your contract ineffective! ]

Amend rule 2483, "Economics", by:
- adding "steel" to the list of currencies (appropriately numbered)
- adding "steel" to the list of refined currencies
- adding "coins" to the list of unrefinable currencies
- removing "coins" from the list of refined currencies

Amend rule 2564, "Processing Facilities", by changing "coins" to "steel" in the
Processing Details of Refineries.

[I'm sick of tired of all of the boilerplate around comments.
Time for a legislative solution.]

Amend Rule 106, "Adopting Proposals", by adding, after the sentence

  "Except as prohibited by other rules, a proposal that
  takes effect CAN and does, as part of its effect, apply the
  changes that it specifies."

the sentence

  "Clearly marked comments are considered to be removed from the
  proposal before it takes effect, unless otherwise stated by
  the proposal."

Title: Office Patch

Co-authors: G., P.S.S


Amend Rule 1006, "Offices", by changing the first sentence to read:
  Officeholder is an office switch tracked by the ADoP, with possible values
  of any person or "vacant" (default).

Change the gamestate to whatever it would be if officeholder had been a switch
for as long as it has been described as such by the rules, with "vacant" as
its default value.

Make omd the Distributor.

Title: Less Critical Patching

Author: Aris

Amend Rule 2162, "Switches", by changing item 2 of the numbered list to
read as follows:
  One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
  exactly one of which should be designated as the default.
  No values other than those listed are possible for
  instances of that switch, except that, if no default is
  specified, then rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
  "null" value is a possible value for that switch, and is
  the default.


Increase the power of Rule 2162 to 3.0.

Title: Regulation Patches
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: G.


[Innumerable minor patches and tweaks. In some cases I have gone slightly
beyond the minimum required for operability. For instance, I made it
a bit easier for the Birthday Tournament to be amended, on the basis that
people are likely to object if an amendment is improper, and to make the
criteria for amendment the same as those for enactment. I believe
that all of my changes are only common sense, but if any are likely
to prove controversial, please let me know.]

Amend Rule 2495, "The Birthday Tournament", to read in full:

  In a timely fashion after the start of June 1 of each year, the
  Herald SHALL propose a set of Regulations governing a Birthday
  Tournament for that year; the Herald CAN also delegate the
  responsibility for creating or running the tournament to another
  player, with that player's consent, by announcement.

  The Birthday Tournament's regulations SHOULD be such that all
  persons who choose to participate have a fair chance of winning
  the tournament (according to its regulations), and a winner
  SHOULD be expected within 2-3 weeks following the tournament's
  initiation.

  After adequate time for discussion of the Birthday Tournament's
  regulations, the Herald (or delegate) CAN initiate a sanctioned
  tournament, promulgating a specified, finalized set of tournament
  regulations, Without 3 Objections. This title may thereafter
  be amended only by the Herald or eir designee Without 3
  Objections. The initiation SHOULD be timed to coincide
  with Agora's Birthday.

Amend Rule 2464, "Tournaments", to read in full:

  A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned to be
  initiated as a tournament by the Rules. The person who initiates a
  tournament is its Gamemaster. If a winner of a tournament is
  determined within within 3 months of its initiation, that person
  or persons win the game, otherwise the tournament concludes
  with no winner.

  A Tournament is governed by set of regulations, created in
  accordance with its parent rule, which have binding control over
  those who freely consent to play the tournament and over the
  tournament itself. Once the tournament is concluded, these regulations
  cease to have any effect, and CAN be repealed by any player by
  announcement.

Amend Rule 2493, "Regulations", by changing the text "officer" to "person".

Title: From each according to eir means
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: twg
Co-authors:


[ This is an attempt at a reset/rebalance that strikes a middle ground between
  completely erasing everyone's progress and leaving the current exponentially-
  growing inequality in place. I'm not positive that I struck the right balance
  but even if it's rejected it can be a starting point for discussion. ]

For each facility owned by a player, transfer all coins owned by that facility
to its owner.

For each zombie owned by a player, transfer all coins owned by that zombie to
its owner.

Decrease the coin balance of each player to the square root (rounded up to the
next largest integer) of however many coins e possessed before this sentence
took effect.

Title: This planet is too chilly
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: twg
Co-authors: Trigon


[ Coal is not my idea; I lifted it from Trigon's proto-proposal. It restricts
  processing facilities a little, which is perhaps a good thing, but it also
  increases the number of land units you need to maintain self-sufficiency,
  which is a bit of a barrier for new players. I figured I might as well put
  it in the pile. ]

Amend rule 2483, "Economics", by adding:
- "coal" to the list of currencies (appropriately numbered); and
- "coal" to the list of unrefinable currencies.

Amend rule 2561, "Asset Generation with Facilities", by changing the third
paragraph to read in full:

  At the end of every Agoran Week, for each Processing facility, as
  many times as possible, Agora destroys a number of assets in the
  possession of that facility and replaces them with a corresponding
  number of different assets, as specified by the rule that creates
  the facility.

Amend rule 2564, "Processing Facilities", by changing every occurrence of the
word "to" to "and 1 coal to".

Amend rule 2563, "Production Facilities", by adding the following new list
item, appropriately numbered:

  Coal Mines
     -  Build Cost: 5 lumber
     -  Upkeep Cost: 2n-2 lumber
     -  Production Details: 3n stones and 2n coal
     -  Upgrade Costs:
        -  Rank 2: 3 coins, 2 lumber
        -  Rank 3: 4 coins, 4 lumber
        -  Rank 4: 5 coins, 4 lumber, 3 stones
        -  Rank 5: 6 coins, 6 lumber, 6 stones, 2 fabric

[ This is functionally equivalent to adding in Trigon's specialisation options,
  but I felt it would have made the proposal a little too long and hard to make
  a decision on. I intend, without objection, to declare apathy, specifying
  myself to win the game. If this passes, we can always simplify it later; the
  specicialisation options do sound fun in principle. ]

Title: Something to use paper for
Adoption index: 2.1
Author: twg
Co-authors:


[ With free proposals, paper is entirely useless - not that anyone was
  producing it anyway - so this is an idea to make mills a little more
  attractive. ]

Enact a new rule of power 2.1, "Libraries", with the following text:

  The following facilities are defined as Miscellaneous facilities:

  Libraries
     -  Build Cost: 1 lumber and 1 paper
     -  Upkeep Cost: n paper
     -  Upgrade Costs:
        -  Rank 2: 1 lumber and 2 paper
        -  Rank 3: 2 lumber and 3 paper

  A player CAN, by announcement, Request Texts from a library e owns
  regarding the reduction of a specified currency in the upkeep costs of a
  specified non-library facility. This has the following effects, which
  last until the end of the message in which the Texts were Requested:

     - The facility's upkeep cost is reduced by n of the currency, where n
       is the rank of the library. (If this would cause the facility's
       upkeep cost to include a negative quantity of any currency, it
       instead includes zero of that currency.)
     - Further attempts to Request Texts specifying the same currency and
       facility are INEFFECTIVE.

[ The above phrasing is a little cumbersome but it was the best way I could
  think of to have the intended effect (each facility can have exactly one
  library help pay for each currency) without producing more things for
  officers to keep track of. ]

  Libraries CANNOT own assets.
