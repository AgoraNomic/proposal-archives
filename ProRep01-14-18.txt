  "Definitions in lower-powered Rules do not overrule common-sense
  interpretations or common definitions of terms in higher-powered rules, but
  may constructively make reasonable clarifications to those definitions. For
  this purpose, a clarification is reasonable if and only if it adds detail
  without changing the underlying general meaning of the term and without
  causing the higher powered rule to be read in a way inconsistent with
  its text."
