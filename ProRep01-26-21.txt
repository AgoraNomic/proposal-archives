[
diffs from proto:
 - Made activity switchable in both directions at will.
 - Defined two verbs.
 - Adjusted time limits as suggested.
 - Added inactivity as a cfj recusal reason.
diffs from v1:
 - Made emailing a deregistree a SHOULD, but changed the method to
   w/o three objections, with the idea that if there's question
   about the email headers or whatever, objections can pragmatically
   handle the issue.
]

Create the following Rule, Activity:

  Activity is a player switch tracked by the Registrar, with values
  Active (default) and Inactive.  To flip a player's activity to
  active (inactive) is to activate (deactivate) em.  The date on
  which each player's activity was last changed is part of the
  Registrar's weekly report.

  A player CAN activate or deactivate emself by announcement.

  Any player CAN, with notice, make a player who has not made a
  public announcement in the past 30 days inactive.

  If a player has been inactive continuously for the past 60 days,
  then any player CAN deregister em without 3 objections. The
  Registrar SHOULD attempt to deregister players who meet this
  condition. The publication of intent for such a deregistration
  SHOULD be sent to the inactive player's registered email address
  at the same time that it is published.


Every player's activity is flipped to active [unneeded I think due
to default behavior, but precautionary?]


Amend Rule 2492 (Recusal) by appending the following text to the
second paragraph:
  The Arbitor CAN recuse an inactive or deregistered judge from a
  case by announcement.

Repeal Rule 2532 (Zombies).
Repeal Rule 2574 (Zombie Life Cycle).
Repeal Rule 2639 (Zombie Phase-Out).
Repeal Rule 1885 (Zombie Auctions).

Amend Rule 2472 (Office Incompatibilities) by deleting:
  A zombie is Overpowered if e holds one or more offices.

Amend Rule 2531 (Defendant's Rights) by deleting:
  (10) it attempts to levy a fine on a zombie for an action that
       its master performed on its behalf.

Amend Rule 2621 (VP Wins) by replacing "non-zombie"  with "active".

Amend Rule 2581 (Official Patent Titles) by deleting:
  - Necromancer, awardable by the Registrar to any player who makes
    such sufficient persistent legal use of zombies that rules need
    to be amended to prevent such practices.

[Checked all the other uses of "active" and "inactive" pertaining to
players, looked like all would work fine under this version]

Amend Rule 2614 (Eclipse Light) by appending the following paragraph:
  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, Emergency Regulations
  CANNOT be enacted, amended, or repealed except as described in
  this Rule.


Amend Rule 683 (Voting on Agoran Decisions) by appending the following
sentence to the final paragraph:
  Submitting and withdrawing ballots is secured.

  it on that Agoran decision, as calculated at the end of that
  decision's voting period.


Change the power of Rule 2168 (Extending the Voting Period) to 2.


[Adding security to R107 makes a jumbled couple of paragraphs
so some logical re-arranging is needed.  I think no text was deleted or
modified other than adding the security.]

Amend Rule 107 (Initiating Agoran Decisions) by replacing:
  The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting period
  for the decision. The voting period lasts for 7 days. The minimum
  voting period for a decision with at least two options is five
  days. The vote collector for a decision with less than two options
  CAN and SHALL end the voting period by announcement, if it has not
  ended already, and provided that e resolves the decision in the
  same message.

  The voting period for a decision cannot be set or changed to a
  duration longer than fourteen days.

  Any entity that is or ever was an organism generally capable of

[This is OP and was only used twice in the whole of last year. We could
reform it so that the Referee could only use it for just reasons,
but honestly I don't think that's a priority â€” this feels like
a waste of space on something that's dangerous and almost unused. If
someone wants to add something like it back later, they can figure out how
to do it in less space.]

Repeal Rule 2479, "Official Injustice".

Amend Rule 2478, "Vigilante Justice", by replacing:

  The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
  Pointing. If the Referee is the perp, then the Arbitor CAN
  become the investigator of that Finger Pointing by announcement.

  The Referee CANNOT Point eir Finger. The Arbitor CANNOT Point eir
  Finger at the Referee. A high crime is any crime specified as
  being class 4 or greater. The Referee CANNOT levy the Cold Hand of
  Justice to punish a high crime, notwithstanding Rule 2478.

with:

  The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
  Pointing. When the Referee's Finger is Pointed or the Referee
  is the perp, the Arbitor is the investigator.

  The Referee CANNOT Point eir Finger at the Arbitor, and the Arbitor
  CANNOT point eir finger at the Referee.

  A high crime is any crime specified as being class 4 or greater.

[The only functionality change is to add a method for giving
people blots for a fee.  The rule has a typo, and needs a logical
rearrangement, so putting in the whole text.]

Amend Rule 2555 (Blots) to read in full.

  Blots are an indestructible fixed currency with ownership
  restricted to persons. A person with 1 or more blots is Impure, a
  person with 0 blots is Pure. An impure unregistered person is a
  Fugitive. The Referee is an office, and the recordkeepor for
  blots.

  To levy a fine of N on a person, where N is a positive integer or
  zero, is to grant em N blots. To expunge a blot is to destroy it.
  Levying fines and destroying blots are each secured with a Power
  Threshold of 1.7.

  A person CAN, by announcement, create a specified number of blots
  in eir possession.

  Any player CAN expunge a blot from a specified person (or emself
  if no one is specified) by paying a fee of one Blot-B-Gone.

  Any player CAN levy a fine of one blot on a specified person by
  paying a fee of two Blot-B-Gones, provided the specified person
  has not already gained two blots or more in the current week.

  At the beginning of each quarter, half (rounded down) of each
  fugitive's blots are destroyed.


Repeal Rule 2479 (Official Injustice).

Title: Strengthening Extra Votes v2.0
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: nix
Co-authors: Aris, Jason


[
This proposal does three things:

* Removes all passive Voting Strength bonuses. They rarely make a
   difference, which makes them uninteresting complexity. That also means
   I'm removing chambers, since they no longer do anything.

* Strengthens Extra Votes. Now they apply to all decisions within a
   voting period. This just makes them feel nicer to use. Also the Buying
   Strength cap is gone.

* Adds a weekly reward for having the highest strength. So there's
   incentive to consider using them even when you're not trying to force
   through/sink a proposal.

* Removes the Economy focus. Since EVs will give a cash reward, they
   fill the same niche as this focus but in a more interesting way.
   Additionally, removing one focus makes the others more competitive.
]

Amend R2422, "Voting Strength", by replacing:

  A player CAN Buy Strength by paying 1 Extra Vote and specifying a
  current Agoran decision on which e is a voter. For each time a
  player has Bought Strength on a decision, eir voting strength is
  1 greater on that decision. If the decision is on a proposal, and
  the proposal's chamber and the player's focus are the same value,
  then eir voting strength is instead 2 greater on that decision.
  A player CANNOT Buy Strength for the same decision more than 3
  times.

with:

  A player CAN Buy Strength by paying a fee of 1 Extra Vote. A
  player's Voting Strength on an ordinary referendum is 1 greater
  for every time e Bought Strength during that decision's voting
  period.

Amend R2645, "The Stones", by replacing:

  - Power Stone (weekly, 40%): A specified player hereby buys
    strength 3 times on a specified unresolved Agoran decision.

with:

  - Power Stone (weekly, 40%): A specified player hereby Buys
    Strength 3 times.

Repeal R2637, "Office Interests".

Repeal R2607, "Proposal Chambers".

Amend R103, "The Speaker", by removing the following:

  The Speaker has voting strength one greater than e would have if e
  did not hold the office.

Amend R2624, "Card Administration, by removing the following:

  Ministry of Economy: 50 boatloads of coins divided by X, rounded
  up; where X is the number of players with their Ministry Focus set
  to Economy. The Ministor SHALL report this value in a timely
  manner after the beginning of the month.

Enact a new Power 1 rule titled "Vocal Voter Verification Award" with
the following text:

  The sole player, if any, who had the highest voting strength
  among all votes cast on all decisions resolved in the last 7 days
  CAN once grant emself 7 boatloads of coins by announcement,
  provided that no referenda initiated in the same message as it
  remain unresolved.
