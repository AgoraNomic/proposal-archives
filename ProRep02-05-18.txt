[ PART I: Removing and Changing Stuff ]

Repeal rule 2500 "Action Points".

Amend rule 2445 "How to Pend a Proposal" by replacing the second
paragraph and subsequent list with:

  Any player CAN flip a specified proposal's imminence to "pending"
  by announcement by spending 1 paper.

Repeal rules 2483 "Economics", 2487 "Shiny Supply Level", and 2497
"Floating Value".

Re-enact rule 2599 "Welcome Packages" by replacing the second paragraph
with:

  If a player has not received a Welcome Package since e most
  recently registered, any player CAN cause em to receive one by
  announcement.

  When a player receives a Welcome Package, Agora creates the
  following assets in eir possession:

    1. 10 coins
    2. 5 lumber
    3. 5 stones
    4. 10 apples
    5. 3 papers

Make all players eligable to recieve Welcome Packages.

Create a new rule "Paydays" (Power=2) and amend it so that its text
reads, in full:

      Whenever a Payday occurs, the following events happen in order:

  1. For each entity possessing shinies, half of eir shinies
     (rounded up) are destroyed.

  2. The following assets are created in the possession of each
     player:
     A. 10 coins
     B. 5 apples
     C. 3 papers

  3. For each office, if a single player held that office for 16 or
     more days in the previous month and e was not issued any Cards
     other than Green for eir conduct in that office during that
     time, the following assets are created in the possession of
     that player:
     A. 3 coins
     B. 1 corn

  The occurrence of Paydays is secured.  At the beginning of each
  month, a Payday occurs.

[PART II: Making Land]

Re-enact rule 1993/1 (Power=2) "The Land of Arcadia" with the text:

  Arcadia is a land entirely defined by the Arcadian Map (the Map).
  The Map is the term for the set of all Land Units.

  The Map divides Arcadia into a finite, discrete number of Units of
  Land, or simply Land. Each Unit of Land is an indestructible asset
  specified by an ordered pair of integers known as its Latitude and
  Longitude.

  Every unique ordered pair of integers within the limits defined in
  the Rules for Latitude and Longitude signifies an existent Unit of
  Land. No other Units of Land exist. Units of Land CAN only be
  created or destroyed by changing the limits of Latitude and
  Longitude defined in the Rules.

  All values for Latitude and Longitude MUST lie between -9 and +9,
  inclusive.

  The Total Land Area of Arcadia is the number of existent Units of
  Land defined by permissible Latitude and Longitude pairs.

Re-enact rule 1994/0 (Power=2) "Ownership of Land" with the text:

  Any existent Land for which ownership has not been explicitly
  changed belongs to Agora.

  Land belonging to Agora is called Public Land. Land belonging to
  a contract is called Communal Land. Land belonging to any other
  entity is called Private Land. Together, Communal Land and Private
  Land are called Proprietary Land.

Re-enact rule 1995/0 (Power=2) "Land Types" with the text:

  Each Unit of Land has a Land Type switch, tracked by the
  Cartographor, whose values are "Black", "White", and "Aether" (the
  default). Changes to Land Type switches are secured. To "change
  the type" of, or to "transform" a Unit of Land is to flip its Type
  switch. A “Unit of X” is a Unit of Land whose Land Type switch has
  the value X.

  When existent Land has not had its Type changed as explicitly
  permitted by the Rules, or has a Type that is not currently
  defined by the Rules, it is considered to have the Land Type of
  Aether. Rules to the contrary nonwithstanding, Units of Aether
  CANNOT be transferred from Agora, or owned by any entity other
  than Agora. If Proprietary Land becomes Aether, the Cartographor
  SHALL transfer it to Agora in a timely fashion.

  Type is a singleton switch with the values of Black and White,
  defaulting to Black. When an act specifies that an alternating
  land type is to be used, the current value of the Alternating Land
  Type switch is used, and the switch is set to the next value of
  the switch.

Re-enact rule 1996/3 (Power=1), renaming it to "The Cartographor" with
the text:

  The Cartographor is an office; its holder is recordkeepor for the
  Land of Arcadia.

  The Cartographor's Weekly Report shall include:

  1. the ownership and land type of all existing land;
  2. all changes in the ownership and land type of existing land
     since the most recent report;
  3. the location for the previous week and the current week of each
     entity with a defined location;
  4. the next alternating land type;
  5. all facilities and their parent land units; and
  6. a list of all preserved land units.

Re-enact rule 1998/2 (Power=1) "Land Topology" with the text:

  Two Units of Land are Adjacent if they have the same Latitude, and
  their Longitudes differ by exactly one; or they have the same
  Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by exactly one.

  Land Unit A is said to be connected to Land Unit B if it is
  possible, to reach B by moving only to adjacent Land Units of the
  same color, starting from A.

Re-enact rule 1999/0 (Power=1) "Entity Location" with the text:

  Location is a player switch, tracked by the Cartographer, whose
  values are ordered pairs of integers where the first value is a
  valid Latitude, and the second is a valid Longitude. The default
  Location is (0, 0).

  To "move" a player is to flip that player’s Location switch to the
  Latitude and Longitude of the destination.

  No other Entity can have a location unless it is defined in a rule
  other than this one. Changes to the Location of an Entity are
  secured. If an Entity is specified by this Rule as having a
  defined Location, but its Location has not been explicitly set or
  changed, its Location is set to (0, 0).

Re-enact rule 2003/11 (Power=1) "Actions in Arcadia" with the text:

  Players CAN destroy:

  1. 1 apple to move from one Land Unit to an adjacent Unit if their
     Land Types are the same and the destination is not Aether;

  2. 2 apples to move from one Land Unit to an adjacent Unit if
     their Land Types differ and the destination is not Aether;

  3. 2 apples to set Land Type of a Land Unit which e owns to any
     Land Type other than Aether, whether or not e is located at
     that Land Unit.

  4. 3 apples to set the Land Type of a Land Unit that is adjacent
     to the Entity's current location, is of type Aether, and is
     owned by Agora, to an alternating Land Type.

  5. 4 apples to set the Land Type of a Land Unit that is adjacent
     to the Entity's current location, is of type Aether, and is
     owned by Agora, to a Land Type of eir choice.

  6. 6 apples to set the Land Type of a Land Unit that is of type
     Aether, and is owned by Agora, to an alternating Land Type.

  Players CAN, while performing the above actions, substitute 3
  apples for 1 corn.

Re-enact rule 2004/3 (Power=1) "Land Auctions" with the text:

  Every Agoran Week, if the number of units of Private Land is less
  than one half the total number of units of Land, an auction SHALL
  be initiated. For this auction, the announcer is the Cartographor,
  the auctioneer is the Cartographor, the lots are chosen as such:

  1. if there exist at least 3 Units of non-Aether Land in the
     possession of Agora: any 3 such Units of Land, to be chosen by
     the Cartographor, each Land Unit in a separate lot;

  2. if there exist fewer than 3 Units of non-Aether Land in the
     possession of Agora: all such Units, each land unit in a
     separate lot;

  and the minimum bid is 1 coin.

Re-enact rule 2022/5 (Power=1), renaming it "Land Transfiguration" with
the text:

  During the second Eastman week of each Agoran Month, the
  Cartographor SHALL perform the following actions in sequence, and
  report these changes:

  1. Every Land Unit, excluding (0, 0) that is not directly
     connected to a unit of Aether, or is not connected by its own
     type to a unit of Aether, shall be transformed to Aether.

  2. Any entities whose locations are on land units so transformed
     shall have their locations set to (0, 0).

  3. If any land unit so transformed is not property of Agora, it
     becomes property of Agora.

[PART III: Creating Facilities]

Create a new rule (Power=2) "Facilities" with the text:

  Facilities are liquid assets tracked by the Cartographor. In order
  for a facility to exist, it MUST be built on a Land Unit. Only one
  facility is allowed per Land Unit. The Land Unit on which a
  Facility is built is considered its Parent Land Unit.

  A player CAN create a facility by announcement on the land unit e
  is on by specifying which type of facility e intends to build and
  destroying the build cost.

  If a player owns any facilities with upkeep costs, e must pay them
  before the first day of the next Agoran month. Failing to do this
  destroys the facility. In the second to last Eastman week of the
  Agoran Month, the Cartographor SHOULD issue a humiliating public
  reminder to all those who have not paid upkeep fees on any of eir
  facilities.

  If the ownership of the Parent Land Unit of a Facilty is changed,
  that facility is transferred along with it.

Create a new rule (Power=2) "Asset Generation with Facilities" with the
text:

  When facilities create assets, the assets are added to the
  facility's possession. The rule that creates a facility CAN
  specify a carrying capacity for assets. If, at any time, the
  amount of an asset in the possession of a facility exceeds that
  asset's carrying capacity, an amount of that asset is destroyed
  until the amount of that asset in the possession of the facility
  is equal to its carrying capacity.

  Each facility is either a production facility or processing
  facility, to be specified in the rule that creates them. At the
  end of every Agoran Week, Agora creates a number of assets in a
  production facility specified by the rule which creates the
  facility.

  At the end of every Agoran Week, Agora destroys any refinable
  assets in the possession of each processing facility that that
  facility can change into refinable assets and replaces them with a
  corresponding number of refined assets to be specified by the rule
  that creates the facility.

  A player can take a number of assets from a facility's inventory
  by announcement if eir location is the same as the facility's and
  the following criteria are met:

  1. if the facility is built on Public Land, none.

  2. if the facility is built on Communal Land, e must be a party to
     that contract and the text of the contract must permit em to do
     so.

  3. if the facility is built on Private Land, e must own the
     facility, or the owner must have consented.

Create a new rule (Power=2) "Facility Ranks" with the text:

  Rank is a facility switch tracked by the Cartographor defaulting
  to 1. Its possible values include all integers between 1 and 5,
  inclusive.

  A player CAN increase the rank of a facility e owns that is at eir
  location by exactly 1 by announcement by paying any upgrade costs
  of the facility for that specific rank.

Create a new rule (Power=2) "Production Facilities" with the text:

  For the purposes of this rule, the variable n is equivalent to the
  rank of the facility.

  The following facilities are defined as production facilities:

  1. Mines
     -  Build Cost: 5 lumber
     -  Upkeep Cost: 2n-2 lumber
     -  Production Details: 3n stones and 2n ore
     -  Upgrade Costs:
        -  Rank 2: 3 coins, 2 lumber
        -  Rank 3: 4 coins, 4 lumber
        -  Rank 4: 5 coins, 4 lumber, 3 stones
        -  Rank 5: 6 coins, 6 lumber, 6 stones, 2 fabric

  2. Orchards
     -  Build Cost: 5 stones
     -  Upkeep Cost: 2n-2 stones
     -  Production Details: 3n apples and 3n lumber
     -  Upgrade Costs:
        -  Rank 2: 3 coins, 2 stones
        -  Rank 3: 4 coins, 4 stones
        -  Rank 4: 5 coins, 4 stones, 3 lumber
        -  Rank 5: 6 coins, 6 stones, 6 lumber, 2 fabric

  3. Farms
     -  Build Cost: 3 lumber and 4 stones
     -  Upkeep Cost: n-1 lumber and n-1 stones
     -  Production Details: 3n corn and 3n cotton
     -  Upgrade Costs:
        -  Rank 2: 3 coins, 1 lumber, 1 stones
        -  Rank 3: 4 coins, 2 lumber, 2 stones
        -  Rank 4: 5 coins, 4 lumber, 4 stones, 1 fabric
        -  Rank 5: 6 coins, 6 lumber, 6 stones, 3 fabric

Create a new rule (Power=2) "Processing Facilities" with the text:

  For the purposes of this rule, the variable n is equivalent to the
  rank of the facility.

  The following facilities are defined as processing facilities:

  1. Refineries
     -  Build Cost: 4 lumber and 8 stones
     -  Upkeep Cost: n^2+2 coins
     -  Processing Details: 1 ore to 2n+3 coins
     -  Upgrade Costs:
        -  Rank 2: 5 coins, 2 lumber, 3 stones
        -  Rank 3: 6 coins, 4 lumber, 4 stones
        -  Rank 4: 7 coins, 4 lumber, 3 stones, 3 fabric
        -  Rank 5: 8 coins, 6 lumber, 6 stones, 4 fabric

  2. Mills
     -  Build Cost: 6 lumber and 6 stones
     -  Upkeep Cost: n^2+2 coins
     -  Processing Details: 1 lumber to 2n+3 paper
     -  Upgrade Costs:
        -  Rank 2: 6 coins, 3 lumber, 3 stones
        -  Rank 3: 7 coins, 4 lumber, 5 stones
        -  Rank 4: 8 coins, 5 lumber, 5 stones, 3 fabric
        -  Rank 5: 9 coins, 6 lumber, 7 stones, 5 fabric

  3. Looms
     - Build Cost: 8 lumber and 4 stones
     - Upkeep Cost: n^2+2 coins
     - Processing Details: 1 cotton to 2n+3 fabric
     -  Upgrade Costs:
        -  Rank 2: 6 coins, 3 lumber, 2 stones
        -  Rank 3: 7 coins, 4 lumber, 3 stones, 3 fabric
        -  Rank 4: 8 coins, 5 lumber, 4 stones, 5 fabric
        -  Rank 5: 9 coins, 6 lumber, 5 stones, 7 fabric

[ All the values in this section are experimental; feel free to contest
  any or all of my decisions. ]

Create a new rule (Power=2) "Economics" with the text:

  The following currencies are defined, and are tracked by the
  Treasuror. They can be owned by Agora, players, contracts, and
  facilities.

  1. ore
  2. stones
  3. lumber
  4. apples
  5. cotton
  6. corn
  7. coins
  8. papers
  9. fabric

[ Probably not all of these will be managed by the Treasuror, but it all
  depends on where the discussion takes us over the next few days.]

  Stones, apples, and corn are considered unrefinable currencies;
  ore, lumber, and cotton are considered refinable currencies; and
  coins, papers, and fabric are considered refined currencies.

  Coins are the official currency of Agora.

Create a new rule (Power=2.6) "Preserved Land" with the text:

  Preservation is a boolean land switch, defaulting to False. The
  preservation switch CAN be set in a regulation promulgated by the
  Cartographor without 2 objections. A Land Unit with its
  preservation switch set to True is considered a preserved Land
  Unit. A Land Unit with its preservation switch set to False is
  considered an unconserved Land Unit.

  Changes to the Land Type or ownership of a preserved land unit
  are secured at a power threshold of 2.5.

  Any Facilities built on a preserved land unit CANNOT have their
  rank changed or be destroyed, rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding.

[ PART IV: Starting off the Map]

Set the land type of all the following land units to White and set their
preservation switch to True:

(-1, -2), (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (0, -2), (0, -1), (0, 0), and (+1, -2).

Set the land type of all the following land units to Black and set their
preservation switch to True:

(-1, +2), (-1, +1), (0, +2), (0, +1), (+1, +2), (+1, +1), (+1, 0), and
(+1, -1).

Create the following facilities:

- Four mines at (-1, -2), (-1, +2), (+1, -2), and (+1, +2).
- Two orchards at (-1, -1) and (+1, +1).
- Two farms at (-1, +1) and (+1, -1).

[ This would make the landscape look something like this:

  land type    facils.
   -21012+     -21012+
  +       +   +       +
  1 wbbbb 1   1 MF.OM 1

  1 wwwbb 1   1 MO.FM 1
  -       -   -       -
   -21012+     -21012+ ]

Set the locations of all players to (0, 0).

Make Trigon the Cartographor.

[ PART V: Replace shinies. ]

Replace all occurances of "shiny" and "shinies" in the ruleset in the
order they appear with "coin" and "coins" respectively.
