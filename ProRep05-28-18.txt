[This proposal implements a 3 coin, 2 apple reward for each captured
stone, possibly livening up the board]

Amend the rule 1998 "Land Topology" to read in full:

  Two Units of Land are Adjacent if they have the same Latitude, and their
  Longitudes differ by exactly one; or they have the same Longitude, and
  their Latitudes differ by exactly one.

  Land Unit A is said to be connected to Land Unit B if it is possible to
  reach B by moving only to adjacent Land Units of the same Land Type,
  starting from A.

  [Here I changed color to Land Type, as color is not defined. So far, it
  didn't break anything, as no LUs were to be changed into Aether]

  A set Land Units is said to be a Subgroup if all of these Land Units have
  the same Land Type are connected to each other.

  A Subgroup is said to be a Group if no set exists such that:
    1) Its elements are all Land Units of that Subgroup and at least one Land
    Unit not an element of that Subgroup.
    2) It is a Subgroup.

[Group = a group of stones in Go]

Amend the rule 2022 "Land Transfiguration" to read in full:

[Changing it so that it happens automatically]

At the end of the second Eastman week of each Agoran Month, the following
happens in sequence:

  1. Every Land Unit, with a preservation switch of False that is not
     directly connected to a unit of Aether, or is not connected by its
     own type to a unit of Aether, shall be transformed to Aether.

     For every Land Unit that has its type changed to Aether by this
     procedure, the player who most recently changed the Land Type of any
     Land Unit such that it is an element of the Full Group of the transformed
     Land Unit or adjacent to any of the Land Units of the Full Group of the
     transformed Land Unit, among the players who aren't Cartographor, receives
     3 coins and 2 apples.

  2. Any entities whose locations are on land units so transformed
     shall have their locations set to (0, 0).

  3. If any land unit so transformed is not property of Agora, it
     becomes property of Agora.

  The Cartographor SHALL announce all of these changes in a timely manner.

Title: Pledge Simplification
Adoption index: 1.7
Author: G.

[The Asset-nature of pledges is complicated and serves no purpose;
if pledges are to be used for out-of-Agora agreements, the Agoran
Consent constraint makes no sense as it's not a voting matter].

Amend Rule 2450 (Pledges) to read in full:

  If a Player makes a clear public pledge (syn. Oath) to perform
  (or refrain from performing) certain actions, then breaking the
  pledge within the pledge's time window is the Class N crime of
  Oathbreaking, where N is 2 unless the pledge explicitly states
  otherwise.  The time window of a pledge is 60 days, unless
  the pledge explicitly states otherwise.

  If breaking the pledge harms specific other parties, the Referee
  SHOULD solicit the opinion of those parties in determining an
  appropriate fine.

  The Notary's Weekly Report includes a copy of all pledges that
  are within their time window, and the dates the pledges were
  made.

All pledges that existed as assets the instant before this Proposal
took effect are considered to have been made as pledges under the
current version of Rule 2450.
