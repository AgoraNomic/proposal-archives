[ This is an attempt at a reset/rebalance that strikes a middle ground between
  completely erasing everyone's progress and leaving the current exponentially-
  growing inequality in place. I'm not positive that I struck the right balance
  but even if it's rejected it can be a starting point for discussion. ]

For each facility owned by a player, transfer all coins owned by that facility
to its owner.

For each zombie owned by a player, transfer all coins owned by that zombie to
its owner.

Decrease the coin balance of each player to the square root (rounded up to the
next largest integer) of however many coins e possessed before this sentence
took effect.

[An alternative algorithm which may be slightly preferable: Quarter
the coin balances instead of square-rooting them.]

If the votes on the proposal titled "From each according to eir
means" authored by twg are such that it has been or will undoubtedly
be ADOPTED, then this proposal has no effect.

For each facility owned by a player, transfer all coins owned by that
facility to its owner.

For each zombie owned by a player, transfer all coins owned by that
zombie to its owner.

Decrease the coin balance of each player to one-quarter (rounded up to
the next largest integer) of however many coins e possessed before
this sentence took effect.

For each zombie owned by a player, transfer all coins owned by that
zombie to its owner.

Title: Point Installation Act v2
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: G., twg


Create the following Rule, Points, AI-2.0:

  Points are the official currency of Agora.  Points can
  only be owned by players and Agora.  Points are tracked by the
  Treasuror.


For each player, create a number of points in eir possession equal
to either (A) the number of coins e had immediately before this proposal
took effect, or (B) 1000, whichever is less.


[Why am I doing things in this rule that could go in existing rules?
To maintain the separation of concerns between different levels of play.
We should be able to do whatever we want to with land without affecting
points, and this is the simplest way to do that. The Rulekeepor may
want to add cross references. However, I am still open to alternative
suggestions.]

Create the following Rule, Earning Points, AI-1.5:

  For a player to 'earn' a point is for it to be created in eir
  possession.  For a player to 'lose' a point is for it to be
  destroyed (if e has one).

  When a decision to adopt a proposal is resolved:

  - If the outcome was ADOPTED, its author earns a number of points
    equal to (the total strength of all valid ballots cast FOR the
    decision - the total strength of all valid ballots cast AGAINST)
    times the adoption index of the decision (final result rounded
    up).

  - If the outcome was REJECTED, its author loses a number of points
    equal to (the minimum of (the total strength of all valid ballots cast
    AGAINST the decision - the total strength of all valid ballots cast FOR)
    and 0).

  - If the outcome was FAILED QUORUM, every active player who didn't
    cast a ballot loses 1 point.

  At the start of each month, for each office, if a single player
  held that office for 16 or more days in the previous month and no
  unforgivable fines were levied on em for eir conduct in that
  office during that time, that player earns 10 points.

  When a player registers who has not been a player at any time in
  the past 30 days, e earns 25 points.

  When a zombie becomes active, e earns 25 points.

  When a judge issues eir first official judgement on a given CFJ, e earns
  5 points.
}

Create 25 points in the possession of each player who is not eligible for
a welcome package.

[The following translates existing rules to the new system.]

Remove coins from all lists it occurs in Rule 2483, "Economics",
renumbering appropriately where necessary, and remove the text
"Coins are the official currency of Agora." from the same rule.

Amend Rule 2559, "Paydays", by: {
* Removing item 1(A) and relettering appropriately; and
* Removing item 2(A) and relettering appropriately;.
}

Amend Rule 2499, "Welcome Packages", by removing item 1 and renumbering
appropriately.

Repeal Rule 2572, "Wishing Fountain".

[Should work fine without the optionally, by NCNA.]

Amend Rule 2549, "Auction Initiation", by removing the text ", optionally"
and changing the text "If no currency is specified, it defaults to coins."
to read "If no currency is specified, it defaults to Agora's official
currency. If no minimum bid is specified, it defaults to 1 of the auction's
currency."

Amend each rule, in ascending numerical order, by changing the work "coin"
to "point" and the word "coins" to "points".

Title: This planet is too chilly
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: twg
Co-authors: Trigon


[ Coal is not my idea; I lifted it from Trigon's proto-proposal. It restricts
  processing facilities a little, which is perhaps a good thing, but it also
  increases the number of land units you need to maintain self-sufficiency,
  which is a bit of a barrier for new players. I figured I might as well put
  it in the pile. ]

Amend rule 2483, "Economics", by adding:
- "coal" to the list of currencies (appropriately numbered); and
- "coal" to the list of unrefinable currencies.

Amend rule 2561, "Asset Generation with Facilities", by changing the third
paragraph to read in full:

  At the end of every Agoran Week, for each Processing facility, as
  many times as possible, Agora destroys a number of assets in the
  possession of that facility and replaces them with a corresponding
  number of different assets, as specified by the rule that creates
  the facility.

Amend rule 2564, "Processing Facilities", by changing every occurrence of the
word "to" to "and 1 coal to".

Amend rule 2563, "Production Facilities", by adding the following new list
item, appropriately numbered:

  Coal Mines
     -  Build Cost: 5 lumber
     -  Upkeep Cost: 2n-2 lumber
     -  Production Details: 3n stones and 2n coal
     -  Upgrade Costs:
        -  Rank 2: 3 coins, 2 lumber
        -  Rank 3: 4 coins, 4 lumber
        -  Rank 4: 5 coins, 4 lumber, 3 stones
        -  Rank 5: 6 coins, 6 lumber, 6 stones, 2 fabric

[ This is functionally equivalent to adding in Trigon's specialisation options,
  but I felt it would have made the proposal a little too long and hard to make
  a decision on. I intend, without objection, to declare apathy, specifying
  myself to win the game. If this passes, we can always simplify it later; the
  specicialisation options do sound fun in principle. ]

Title: Something to use paper for
Adoption index: 2.1
Author: twg
Co-authors:


[ With free proposals, paper is entirely useless - not that anyone was
  producing it anyway - so this is an idea to make mills a little more
  attractive. ]

Enact a new rule of power 2.1, "Libraries", with the following text:

  The following facilities are defined as Miscellaneous facilities:

  Libraries
     -  Build Cost: 1 lumber and 1 paper
     -  Upkeep Cost: n paper
     -  Upgrade Costs:
        -  Rank 2: 1 lumber and 2 paper
        -  Rank 3: 2 lumber and 3 paper

  A player CAN, by announcement, Request Texts from a library e owns
  regarding the reduction of a specified currency in the upkeep costs of a
  specified non-library facility. This has the following effects, which
  last until the end of the message in which the Texts were Requested:

     - The facility's upkeep cost is reduced by n of the currency, where n
       is the rank of the library. (If this would cause the facility's
       upkeep cost to include a negative quantity of any currency, it
       instead includes zero of that currency.)
     - Further attempts to Request Texts specifying the same currency and
       facility are INEFFECTIVE.

[ The above phrasing is a little cumbersome but it was the best way I could
  think of to have the intended effect (each facility can have exactly one
  library help pay for each currency) without producing more things for
  officers to keep track of. ]

  Libraries CANNOT own assets.
