Title: Agoraculture
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: o
Co-authors: babelian


Enact a new rule, with power 1.0, titled "Farm Rate", with the following text:

  The Farm Rate is a natural singleton switch, tracked by the
  Agronomist.

Set the Farm Rate to 20.

Enact a new rule, with power 2.0, titled "Agoraculture", with the following
text:

  Each Estate has a Farm switch, tracked by the Agronomist, with
  values "farmed" and "unfarmed", defaulting to "unfarmed". Changes
  to Farm switches are secured. An Estate whose Farm switch is
  "farmed" is a Farm, and its owner is the Farmer of that Estate.

  In the first week of an Agoran month, the owner of an unfarmed
  Estate MAY flip its Farm switch to "farmed" by announcement, if e
  pays Agora a number of shinies equal to the Farm Rate.

  In the first week of an Agoran month, the owner of a Farm MAY till
  the farm by announcement, if e pays Agora a number of shinies equal
  to the Farm Rate. If the Farmer of an Estate does not till it
  within the first week of an Agoran month, the Agronomist CAN flip
  its Farm switch to "unfarmed" by announcement, and SHALL do so in a
  timely fashion.

  When an Estate is transferred to Agora or to an Organization, its
  Farm switch is set to "unfarmed" immediately afterwards.

Enact a new rule, with power 2.0, titled "Comestibles", with the following text:

  A Comestible is a type of liquid asset, which can be owned by
  players. Creating Comestibles is secured. The recordkeepor of
  Comestibles is the Agronomist.

  The Farmer of an Estate may offer Comestibles by announcement,
  naming a number of Comestibles offered and a price per Comestible
  in Shinies. A player CANNOT offer more Comestibles in a month than
  10 times the number of Farms e owns. The Farmer is ENCOURAGED to
  name the kind of Comestibles on offer after a plant, vegetable,
  grain, livestock, or other farm good.

  A player other than the offering Farmer may accept a Comestibles
  offer by announcement to create that number of Comestibles in eir
  possession, if e pays the offering Farmer the price per Comestible
  named in the offer times the number of Comestbiles offered. The
  Value of a Comestible created this way is equal to the price per
  Comestible offered by the Farmer.

  An offer expires at the end of the Agoran month in which it is
  made. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an offer CANNOT be
  accepted if it has expired.

  During an Agoran Decision, a player can increase their voting
  strength on that decision by destroying (syn. "eating",
  "consuming") Comestibles. Eir voting strength is increased by
  one-tenth the total Value of the Comestibles destroyed this way,
  rounded down, to a maximum of 5.

  A Comestible is an Expired Comestible if it was created by
  accepting an offer announced more than three Agoran months ago. An
  Expired Comestible CANNOT be consumed to increase voting strength,
  and MAY be destroyed by any player, by announcement. The Agronomist
  SHALL destroy all Expired Comestibles at the start of each Agoran
  month.

Enact a new rule, with power 2.0, titled “The Agronomist”, with the following
text:

  The Agronomist is an office.

  The Agronomist's weekly report includes:

  * A list of Farms and their owners.

  * A list of Comestibles offers that have not been accepted and have
    not expired.

Make babelian the Agronomist.

Title: Debts
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: nichdel
Co-authors: o, grok, Aris


Enact a new, power-2 rule titled "Debts"

  Debts are a fixed, indestructible currency. The Secretary is the
  recordkeepor of debts.

  If a rule specifies something can be done by 'accruing x Debt' then a
  player CAN do the specified action by increasing eir Debt balance by
  x.

  A player CAN, by announcement, pay Agora a specified number of
  shinies to decrease eir Debts balance by the same number. Any attempt
  to decrease any Debts balance past 0 is INEFFECTIVE.

Repeal "Action Points"

Amend R991 "Calls for Judgement" to read, in full:

  Any person (the initiator) can initiate a Call for Judgement (CFJ,
  syn. Judicial Case), specifying a statement to be inquired into by
  either paying the CFJ Fee in shinies or by accruing the same amount
  of debt. If neither method is specified, the initiator does the
  latter.

  The CFJ Fee is N/5 * 1/20th the Floating Value, where N is the number
  of CFJs the initiator has already initiated in the same Agoran Week.

  If a person is not a player, e can initiate a CFJ without paying
  shinies or increasing eir Debts balance.

  When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e may optionally bar
  one person from the case.

  At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
  assigned exactly one judgement.

  The Arbitor is an office, responsible for the administration of
  justice in a manner that is fair for emself, if not for the rest of
  Agora.

  When a CFJ has no judge assigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any player
  to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so within a week. The
  players eligible to be assigned as judge are all players except the
  initiator and the person barred (if any). The Arbitor SHALL assign
  judges over time such that all interested players have reasonably
  equal opportunities to judge. If a CFJ has no judge assigned, then
  any player eligible to judge that CFJ CAN assign it to emself Without
  3 Objections.

  When the Arbitor assigns a CFJ a judge, e SHOULD note the Debts
  accrued, if any, when the CFJ was initiated.

Amend "Economic Wins" by replacing:

  While a player has Stamps made by at least 10 different players e MAY
  destroy 10 stamps made by 10 different players by announcement to win
  the game.

with:

  While a player has Stamps made by at least 10 different players and
  eir Debts balance is 0, e MAY destroy 10 stamps e owns made by 10
  different players by announcement to win the game.

and replacing:

  Once per month, a player MAY, by announcement, transfer to Agora the
  Stamp Value, in shinies, to create a Stamp.

with:

  Once per month, any player whose Debts balance is 0 MAY, by
  announcement, transfer to Agora the Stamp Value, in shinies, to
  create a Stamp.

Amend "Estates Auctions" by replacing:

  During an auction, any player or organization may bid any number of
  Shinies by announcement.

with:

  During an auction, any player whose Debts balance is 0 or any
  organization may bid any number of Shinies by announcement.

Amend "Rewards" by replacing:

  Below is an exhaustive list of Reward Conditions and eir rewards:

    * The following two only apply to proposals that were pended via
    spending shinies:

      - Being the author of an adopted proposal: 1/40th the current

Amend R2445 "How to Pend a Proposal" to read, in full:

  Imminence is a switch, tracked by the Promotor, possessed by
  proposals in the Proposal Pool, whose value is either "pending" or
  "not pending" (default).

  Any player CAN flip a specified proposal's imminence to "pending" by
  announcement by paying Agora 1/20th the Floating Value or by accruing
  the same amount of Debt. If neither method is specified, that player
  does the latter.

Amend R1607 "Distribution" by, after the paragraph starting with "In a
given Agoran week", adding:

  accrued, if any, when the proposal was pended.

Amend Rule 2445 (How to Pend a Proposal) by appending the following
paragraph:

  An Official Proposal is a proposal designated as such by the
  Rules; generally official proposals that are created as part of
  an Officer's duties. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an
  Official proposal is always pending. Rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding, players CANNOT claim rewards for the adoption
  of an Official proposal.


Re-enact Rule 2309 (The Propose-O-Matic), with the following text:

  The Fearmongor is an Office. Its holder is responsible for
  ensuring the continuous change of the ruleset.

  Each month, the Fearmongor SHALL do the following as part of
  eir duties:

    1) Select two existing rules at random. For each of those
      rules, submit an Official proposal with AI equal to that
      rules' power. One proposal SHALL specify only to repeal
      its rule; the other SHALL specify only to amend its rule.

    3) Select a previous rule that was repealed over 1 year
      ago, and has not been so selected in the past 6 months.
      Submit an Official proposal of the appropriate AI to
      re-enact the rule at its previous power, using any
      past version of the rule as a basis and making minimal
      modifications to that text to allow the rule to function
      in the current ruleset.


G. is hereby installed as the Office holder for Fearmongor.

[The old rule was "each week", but I think that's too much.  No
salary, because the job is it's own reward :) ].
