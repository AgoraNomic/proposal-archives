Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason Cobb
Co-authors: Aris


Amend Rule 1728 to read, in whole:

  The following methods of taking actions are known as "dependent
  actions":

  1. without N objections, where N is a positive integer no greater
  than 8 ("without objection" is shorthand for this method with N = 1);

  2. with N support, where N is a positive integer ("with support" is
  shorthand for this method with N = 1);

  3. with N Agoran consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1 with
  a minimum of 1 ("With Agoran consent" is shorthand for this method
  with N = 1);

  4. with notice; or

  5. with T notice, where T is a time period.

  N is 1 unless otherwise specified.


Amend Rule 2595 as follows:

  In the first sub-bullet under item 2 of the only list, replace the
  text "with T Notice" with the text "with T notice".

  In the second sub-bullet under item 2 of the only list, replace the
  text "Without N Objections, With N Support, or With N Agoran
  Consent" with the text "without N objections, with N support, or
  with N Agoran Consent".

  In the first sub-bullet under item 3 of the only list, replace the
  text "With N Support" with the text "with N support".

  In the second sub-bullet under item 3 of the only list, replace the
  text "Without N Objections, With N Agoran Consent, or With Notice"
  with the text "without N objections, with N Agoran consent, or with
  notice".

  In the third sub-bullet under item 3 of the only list, replace the
  text "With T Notice" with the text "with T notice".

  In the final paragraph, replace the text "with N Agoran Consent"
  with the text "with N Agoran consent".

Amend the only list in Rule 2124 ("Agoran Satisfaction") to read:

  1. The action is to be performed Without N objections, and there are
  at least N Objectors to that intent.

  2. The action is to be performed With N support, and there are fewer
  than than N Supporters of that intent.

  3. The action is to be performed with N Agoran consent, and the
  number of Supporters of the intent is less than or equal to N times
  the number of Objectors to the intent.

Title: Repairing Defeated Spaceships v3
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason Cobb
Co-authors: twg, Jason Cobb


Amend Rule 2595 by replacing the text "Any player CAN, by
announcement, spend a coin to increase the Armour of a Pilotable
Spaceship e owns by 1." with the text "Any player CAN pay a fee of 1
coin to increase the Armour of a Pilotable Spaceship in eir possession
by 1 or pay a fee of 3 coins to increase the Armour of a Defeated
Spaceship by 1."

[Comment: Right now, Defeated Spaceships are effectively dead forever.
If a player goes all out and kills the other person's Spaceship, they
are effectively banished from the subgame forever. To solve this, a
slight penalty is added for repairing a Defeated spaceship. The number
of coins remains small because it is just a subgame.]

Amend Rule 2591 by replacing the text "Spaceships are a class of fixed
asset" with "Spaceships are a class of fixed indestructible asset".

[Change from the original: "pay... 1 coin increase" -> "pay... 1 coin to
increase"]

Title: Cancelling Proposals (arr. for violin)
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jacob Arduino
Co-authors: twg, G.


[ This has bugged me for a while (no pun intended): if a broken proposal makes
   it to its voting period, even if the error is then discovered, it tends not
   to percolate through to everyone doing the voting, and the proposal gets
   adopted anyway. I've been trying to get around this by just endorsing the
   proposal's author, on the basis that e's the most likely to notice if there
   is a problem and can then change eir vote to AGAINST, but that has its own
   problems. I feel this is a fairly neat solution with enough safeguards to
   stop it being abused. ]

[ This second version removes reliance on the Assessor to support the action,
  and adds protection against the Speaker's delay (which would function here
  as a veto). ]

Enact a new rule, "Cancelling Erroneous Proposals", Power=3.0, with the
following text:

  During the voting period of an Agoran decision determining whether or not
  to adopt a proposal, its author CAN with support cancel the decision.

  It is RECOMMENDED that this ability only be used if the proposal contains
  a textual error preventing it from having the effect its author intended.

  The Speaker is not eligible to object to an announcement of intent to
  perform an action permitted by this rule.

Amend Rule 955, "Determining the Will of Agora", by adding the following list
item to the unnumbered list in between the two previously existing items:

  - If the decision has been cancelled, as permitted by rules of power 3 or
    greater, the outcome is instead CANCELLED.
