The full text of the aforementioned proposals is included below.

ID: 7852
Title: Granular Paydays (v3)
Adoption Index: 1.0
Author: nichdel
Co-author(s): Aris, o, G.

[v3: added the clarification of 'duty-fulfilling' reports]

[v2: Changed the switches to be natural, fixed not specifying what
offices are paid, and deleted a typo that suggested the report was paid
instead of the player.]

Flip the Payrate of every office to 2.

Amend 2484 (Payday) to read, in full:

      Payrate is a natural office switch, tracked by the ADoP, with a
      default value of 2. Report Rate is a natural office switch,
      tracked by the ADoP, with a default value of 2.

[Add in Report Rate, which can be adjusted by-office.]

      At the start of each month, if Agora's Balance is not 0 or less,
      Agora SHALL pay each player 10 shinies.

[Nothing changed here.]

      Immediately afterward, for each duty-fulfilling report published
      last month (in chronological order of publication), Agora SHALL
      pay the publisher of the report the Report Rate for the office
      the report is associated with unless paying would leave Agora's
      balance at a negative value.

[Pay out for published reports before offices, in a way similar to how
offices are paid. It's very important to note that, if Report Rates
were not equal, it'd be possible to pay the 1st and 3rd reports but not
the 2nd, if the 2nd would make Agora's balance negative but the 3rd
would not.]

      Immediately afterward, for each office (first in ascending order
      of Payrate, then in descending alphabetical order of office
      name), Agora SHALL pay the holder of the office that office's
      Payrate value unless paying would leave Agora's balance at a
      negative value.

[This paragraph is rewritten to hopefully be more clear, but it is
functionally the same except for changing '0 or less' to 'negative'.]
