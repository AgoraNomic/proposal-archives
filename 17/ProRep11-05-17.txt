Title: A Most Ingenious Paradox
Adoption index: 1.7
Author: Alexis
Co-authors:


Text in square brackets is not a part of this proposal and has no
effect.

Enact a new power-1 rule entitled "Win by Paradox":

  If a CFJ has been assigned a judgment of PARADOXICAL continuously
  for at least 7 days, and e has not done so already in respect of
  that CFJ, then that case's initiator CAN, by announcement, win the
  game.

  A player who wins in this fashion SHOULD submit a proposal to
  prevent the paradox from arising again.

Amend rule 591 by replacing:

  The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
  the truth or falsity of the statement at the time the inquiry case
  was initiated (if its truth value changed at that time, then its
  initial truth value is used):

with:

  The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
  the facts and legal situation at the time the inquiry case was
  initiated, not taking into account any events since that time:

[This is to prevent changing facts not related to truth or falsity, e.g.
availability of information, from affecting outcomes.]

and by replacing:

  * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
  if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
  reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
  answered with another valid judgement.

with:

  * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
  if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
  reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
  answered with another valid judgement. DISMISS is not
  appropriate if PARADOXICAL is appropriate.

and by appending to the end:

  * PARADOXICAL, appropriate if the statement is logically
    undecidable as a result of a paradox or or other irresovable
    logical situation. PARADOXICAL is not appropriate if IRRELEVANT
    is appropriate, nor is it appropriate if the undecidability
    arises from the case itself.

[The reference to IRRELEVANT is to prevent multiple wins from the same
paradox.]
