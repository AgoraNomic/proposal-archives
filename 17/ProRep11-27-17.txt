Amend Rule 2516 (Passive Income) to read:

  The Treasuror CAN, once each month, and SHALL, in a timely fashion
  after the start of each month, publish a Payday Notice. The effect
  of such a Notice is to:

     1. Destroy all Shinies in Agora's possession.

     2. Create 25 Shinies in the possession of each player.

     3. For each office, if a single player held that office for
        16 or more days in the previous month and did not receive
        a card other than Green during that time for performance or
        nonperformance of that office's duties, create 10 shinies
        in the possession of that player.


Amend Rule 2497 (Floating Value) to read:

  Floating Value is a natural singleton switch, tracked by the
  Treasuror.

  The Treasuror CAN, once each month, and SHALL, in a timely
  fashion after the start of each month, publish a valid Notice
  of Agoran Productivity, containing eir best estimate of the
  total number of shinies that were in Agora's possession at
  the end of the previous month.  The Notice is invalid if the
  estimate differs from the correct value by more than 10%, and
  the error is publicly identified within one week of its
  publication.

  The effect of a valid Notice of Agoran Productivity is to flip
  the Floating Value to the announced estimate.

  The following Floating Derived Values are defined:

  * Stamp Value: 1/5th of the Floating Value, rounded up.

  * Pend Cost: 1/10th of the Floating Value, rounded up.

  * CFJ Cost: 1/20th of the Floating Value, rounded up.

  The Treasuror's weekly report includes all floating-derived
  values defined by the Rules.


Amend Rule 2498 (Economic Wins) by replacing:
  If Agora owns at least as many Shinies as the current Stamp Value,
  a player CAN, by announcement, destroy a Stamp e owns to cause
  Agora to transfer the Stamp Value, in shinies, to emself.
with:
  A player CAN, by announcement, destroy a Stamp e owns to create,
  in eir possession, a number of shinies equal the Stamp Value.
  If the Stamp's creator was not the destroying player, half
  the Stamp value (rounded up) in shinies are created in the
  possession of the Stamp's creator.

[Encourages stamp trading!!]


Amend Rule 2499 (Welcome Packages) by replacing:
  Agora transfers 50 shinies to em.
with:
  25 shinies are created in eir possession.


Amend Rule 2483 (Economics) by replacing:
  The Treasuror is the recordkeepor for shinies.
with:
  The Treasuror is an Office and the recordkeepor for shinies.


Repeal Rule 2487 (Shiny Supply Level).
Repeal Rule 2456 (The Treasuror).
Repeal Rule 2500 (Action Points).


Amend Rule 2445 (How to Pend a Proposal) by replacing:
  a) spending 1 Action Point, OR

  b) spending the current Pend Cost in shinies.
with:
  a) spending the current Pend Cost in shinies, OR

  b) Without 2 Objections.  Players SHOULD object unless the
     proposal consists entirely of bug fixes or minor
     playability adjustments for the good of the game overall.


Amend Rule 991 (Calls for Judgement) by replacing:
  a) by announcement, and spending 1 Action Point, OR

  b) by announcement, and spending the current CFJ cost in shinies,
     OR

  c) by announcement if e is not a player.
with:
  a) by announcement, and spending the current CFJ cost in shinies,
     OR

  b) Without 2 Objections.  Players SHOULD object unless paying
     with shinies is a significant barrier to the Caller's
     ability to seek a resolution to the controversy.


Amend Rule 2496 (Rewards) to read in full:
  A Reward is a specified amount of a currency associated with a
  Reward Condition. For each time a player meets a Reward Condition,
  e CAN claim the specified award, by announcement, exactly once
  within 24 hours of meeting the Reward Condition.  When a player
  'claims' a Reward, Agora transfers the specified amount of that
  currency to the player, if Agora possesses sufficient currency to
  do so.

[The basic definition of "reward" is useful in general so we keep it].

  syn. Judicial Case) by announcement, specifying a statement to be
  inquired into.

Amend rule 2445 (How to Pend a Proposal) by replacing the second

Amend rule 2166 (Assets) by replacing
  A contract's text can specify whether or not that contract is
  willing to receive assets or a class of assets. Generally, a
  contract CANNOT be given assets it is unwilling to receive. If the
  contract is silent on the matter, or if its willingness is
  indeterminate or the subject of a inextricable conditional, the
  procedure to determine its willingness is as follows:

    1. If the contract appears to anticipate being given assets,
       other than for sustenance (e.g. by authorizing parties to
       spend the contract's assets), then the contract is willing to
       receive all assets.

    2. Otherwise, it is unwilling to receive all assets.

  The previous paragraph (including the list) notwithstanding, a
  contract CAN be given 1 shiny a month for its sustenance payment,
  so long as it never has more than 1 shiny at a time.
with

  contract CANNOT be given assets it is unwilling to receive. If the
  contract is silent on the matter, or if its willingness is
